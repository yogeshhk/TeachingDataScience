\section{Bullet points to help learning}

\emph{This is a summary list of core topics in the lecture and
  intended as a guide for preparation for the exam. Test yourself also
  on the bullet points in the table of contents. Going through all
  exercises is equally important.}

\item Robot dynamics \& joint/operational space control

-- General form of the dynamics equation

-- Joint space control: given desired $\ddot q^*$, choose $u^* = M(q)~
\ddot q^* + F(q,\dot q)$

-- Operational space control: given desired $\ddot y^*$, choose $u^* =
T^\sharp (\ddot y^* - \dot J \dot q + T F)$ (5:31, 32, 34)
