\item \textbf{Motion} was \emph{the} driving force to develop
intelligence
\begin{items}
\item motion needs control \& decision making $\oto$ fast information processing
\item motion needs anticipation \& planning
\item motion needs perception
\item motion needs spatial representations
\end{items}

\item \textbf{Manipulation} requires to acknowledge the structure
(geometry, physics, objects) of the real world. Classical AI does not

\slide{Robotics as intelligence research}{

\item Machine Learning and AI are \textbf{computational}
disciplines, which had great success with statistical modelling,
analysis of data sets, symbolic reasoning. But they have not solved
\emph{autonomous learning, acting \& reasoning in real worlds.}

\item Neurosciences and psychology are \textbf{descriptive} sciences, either on
the biological or cognitive level, e.g.\ with geat sucesses to
describe and cure certain deceases. But they are not sufficient to
create intelligent systems.

\item Robotics is the only \textbf{synthetic} discipline to understand
intelligent behavior in natural worlds. Robotics tells us what the
actual problems are when trying to organize behavior in natural
worlds.
