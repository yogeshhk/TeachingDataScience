%% \exsection{Trajectory optimization}

%% On slide 3:29 (lecture 3 page 29) we defined the cost function for a
%% single step as
%% $$f(q_{t\po}) =~ \norm{q_{t\po}-q_t}_{W}^2
%%  + \Phi(q_{t\po})^\T \Phi(q_{t\po})$$ where $\Phi$ comprises $m$
%%  different tasks (with map $\phi_i$, target $y^*_i$ and precision
%%  $\r_i$).

%% Assume we want to find a joint trajectory $q_{0:T}$ that,
%% in \emph{each} time slice $t$ tries to fulfill $m$ tasks (with target
%% $y^t_i$ and precision $\r^t_i$ for the $i$th task in time slice $t$).

%% a) What is an appropriate cost function $f(q_{0:T})$ for the whole
%% trajectory?

%% b) Describe an algorithm in pseudo-code that optimizes the trajectory
%% w.r.t.\ this cost function. You are free to pick any algorithm --
%% ideally exploiting 2nd order information.


\exsection{Verify some things from the lecture}

a) On slide 02:46 it says that
\begin{align*}
&\argmin_q \norm{q-q_0}_W^2 + \norm{\Phi(q)}^2 \\
 &\qquad\approx q_0 - (J^\T J + W)^\1 J^\T~ \Phi(q_0)
 =q_0 - J^\# \Phi(q_0)
\end{align*}
where the approximation $\approx$ means that we use the local
linearization $\Phi(q) = \Phi(q_0) + J (q-q_0)$. Verify this.

b) On slide 02:34 there is a term $(\Id - J^\# J)$ called nullspace
 projection. Verify that for $\r\to\infty$ (and $C=\r\Id$) and any choice
 of $a\in\RRR^n$
$$ \d q = (\Id - J^\# J) a ~ \To ~ \d y=0 $$
(assuming linearity of $\phi$, i.e., $J \d q=\d
y$). Note: this means that any choice of $a$, the motion $(\Id - J^\# J) a$ will
not change the ``endeffector position'' $y$.

\begin{solution}
Due to the Woodbury identity, the pseudo inverse can be written in two
ways:
\begin{align}
J^\#
 &= (W/\r + J^\T J)^\1 J^\T 
  = W^\1 J^\T (J W^\1 J^\T + \Id/\r)^\1
\end{align}
Note that you CANNOT USE THE FIRST VERSION to take the limit
$\r\to\infty$ because $J^\T J$ is not invertible. (It is a $n\times
n$-matrix of rank $d$.) But you can use the second version to let
$\r\to\infty$ and $J^\# \to W^\1 J^\T (J W^\1 J^\T)^\1$, where $J W^\1
J^\T$ is a $d\times d$-matrix with full rank (for non-singular
$J$). Therefore we have
\begin{align}
\d y
&= J \d q
 = J (\Id - J^\# J) a \\
&= [J - J  W^\1 J^\T (J W^\1 J^\T)^\1 J] a = [J-J]a = 0
\end{align}
\end{solution}

c) On slide 02:27 we derived the basic inverse kinematics law. Verify
that (assuming linearity of $\phi$) for $C\to\infty$ the desired task
is fulfilled exactly, i.e., $\phi(q^*) = y^*$. By writing $C\to\infty$
we mean that $C$ is a matrix of the form $C=\r C_0$, $\r\in\RRR$, and
we take the limit $\r\to\infty$.


%% \show[.25]{optim-InvKin}

%% We want to find an optimum for joint angle step $\d q\in\RRR^n$
%% under two ``competing tasks'': On the one hand, we want $\d q$ to be
%% small (be lazy); on the other hand, we want $\d q$ to be close to
%% the hyperplane $J\d q-\d y=0$, for given $J\in\RRR^{d\times n}$
%% and $\d y\in\RRR^d$. We associate square costs to both tasks and
%% define the cost function
%% \begin{align} \label{eq1}
%% f(\d q)
%%  &= \d q^\T~ W~ \d q + (J\d q-\d y)^\T~ C~ (J\d q-\d y) ~.
%% \end{align}
%% We introduced metrics (=symmetric positive definite matrix)
%% $W \in\RRR^{n\times n}$ and $C \in \RRR^{d\times d}$ to weight the
%% cost terms. Find the optimal $\d q^* = \argmin_{\d q} f(\d q)$.

%% \emph{Simplification:} If you like, first solve a simplified problem: 
%% Drop $W$ and $C$ (let $W$ and $C$ be Euclidean metrics).

%% \emph{Bonus:} What is the solution for $C \to \infty\Id$ (enforcing
%% the solution to be definitely on the hyperplane)? Tip: Before taking the limit,
%% rewrite the solution using the \emph{Woodbury identity} (for positive
%% definite matrices $W$ and $C$):
%% \begin{align}
%% (W + J^\T C J)^\1 J^\T C = W^\1 J^\T (C^\1 + J W^\1 J^\T)^\1 ~.
%% \end{align}

%% \emph{For discussion during exercises:} How are the solutions related to the
%% so-called pseudo-inverse? How are they related to singularities, the
%% ``singularity robust Jacobian'' and ``Tikhonov regularization''?

%% \exsection{Motion profiles}

%% Construct a motion profile that accelerates constantly in the first
%% quarter of the trajectory, then moves with constant velocity, then
%% decelerates constantly in the last quarter. Write down the equation
%% $\text{MP}:~ [0,1] \mapsto [0,1]$.

\exsection{Multiple task variables}

Consider again the last week's exercise where the robot moved his hand
in a circle (Exercise 3.2d).

a) We've seen that the solution does track the circle nicely, but the
trajectory ``gets lost'' in joint space, leading to very strange
postures. We can fix this by adding more tasks, esp.\ a task that
permanently tries to (moderatly) minimize the distance of the
configuration $q$ to a natural posture $q_\text{home}$. Realize this
by adding a respective task to the code given on the next page.

b) Make the robot simultaneously point upward with the left hand. Use 
@kinematicsVec@ and @jacobianVec@ for this.

\newpage

\begin{code}\begin{verbatim}
void multiTask(){
  Simulator S("man.ors");
  arr q,q_home,y_target,y,J,W,Phi,PhiJ;
  uint n = S.getJointDimension();

  S.getJointAngles(q);
  W.setDiag(1.,n); //we define W as identity matrix
  q_home = q; //we store the initial posture as q_home

  for(uint i=0;i<10000;i++){
    Phi.clear();
    PhiJ.clear();

    //1st task: track with right hand
    y_target = ARR(-0.2, -0.4, 1.1); 
    y_target += .2 * ARR(cos((double)i/20), 0, sin((double)i/20)); 
    S.kinematicsPos(y,"handR");
    S.jacobianPos  (J,"handR");

    Phi .append( 1e2 * (y - y_target) );  //rho = 1e4 (cp. slide 02:45)
    PhiJ.append( 1e2 * J );

    //add the "stay close to home" task here
    
    //add another task for the left hand here, if you like

    //compute joint updates
    q -= inverse(~PhiJ*PhiJ + W)*~PhiJ* Phi; //(cp. slide 02:46)
    S.setJointAngles(q);
  }
}
\end{verbatim}\end{code}


%% In our @libRoboticsCourse.12.tgz@ in
%% @teaching/RoboticsCourse/02-pegInAHole@ you find an example problem
%% (rename @main.problem.cpp@ to @main.cpp@), where the goal is to stick
%% the green peg into the blue ``hole''.

%% The initial implementation fails: it does not find an appropriate path
%% to insert the peg from the top; and it does not use
%% @kinematicsVec(y,"peg")@ with target @ARR(0,0,-1)@ to force the peg to
%% point down.

%% Implement a nice peg-in-a-hole movement. You may devide the whole
%% movement in several sections and use task space or joint space
%% interpolations with a smooth motion profiles within each. The motion
%% should reach the final position with very high accuracy in finite time
%% and without collisions.

%% Bonus: How can we apply joint space interpolation? How could one avoid
%% zero velocities at the junction of sections?



%% , using sine motion profiles
%% and task space interpolation

%%  const char* bodyName, const arr* vec=0); //get the z-axis of the body
%%   void jacobianVec(arr& J, const char* bodyName, const arr* vec=0);   //get the 
%% and
%% implemented reactive controller fails.)

%% a) First ignore collisions. Write an algorithms that finds a posture
%% $q_T$ that places the pin into the whole and pointing downward. For
%% this minimize the cost function given on slide 3:47.  Note that in this
%% cost function the $q_0$ is fixed (and not the current posture $q_k$ at
%% which we computed $J$ and $\phi$). Optimization can therefore be done
%% by iteration the Gauss-Newton (see Wikipedia) update, in our case:
%% $$
%% q_{k\po} \gets q_k + \a (J^\T J + W)^\1 [ W(q_k-q_0) + J^\T \Phi(q_k)]
%% $$
%% For $\a=1$ this iteration might diverge, for smaller $\a\approx .01$
%% it should converge to an optimal $q_T$.

%% b) Still ignore collision. Generate a trajectory by interpolating in
%% joint space between $q_0$ and $q_T$ with a sine profile (with
%% $T=100$). Also generate a trajectory by interpolating in task space
%% (of the position task as well as vector task) and projecting it to
%% joint space using inverse kinematics. How do they compare?

%% c) Try to generate a collision free trajectory to place the pin into
%% the whole. Any heuristics are allowed. A trick might be to work
%% backward from $q_T$.
