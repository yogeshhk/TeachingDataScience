\exsection{Fun with Euler-Lagrange}

\show[.3]{2dracer}

Consider an inverted pendulum mounted on a wheel in the 2D x-z-plane;
similar to a Segway. The exercise is to derive the Euler-Lagrange
equation for this system.

Tips:
\begin{itemize}
\item Strictly follow the scheme we discussed on slide 03:23.
\item Use the generalized coordinates
\begin{align}
q=(x,\t)
\end{align}
with $x$ is the position of the wheel and $\t$ the angle of the
pendulum relative to the world-vertical.
\item The system can be parameterized by
\begin{items}
\item $m_A, I_A, m_B, I_B$: masses and inertias of bodies $A$ (=wheel)
  and $B$ (=pendulum)
\item $r$: radius of the wheel
\item $l$: length of the pendulum (height of its COM)
\end{items}
\item Describe the \textbf{pose} of every body (depending on $q$) by
the $(x,z,\p)$ coordinate: its position in the x-z-plane, and its
rotation relative to the world-vertical. Accordingly represent the
(linear and angular) velocities as a 3-vector.
\item In this 3-dim space, the mass matrix of every body is
\begin{align}
M_i = \mat{ccc}{m_i & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & m_i & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & I_i}
\end{align}
\end{itemize}

\exsection{Optional: PD control to hold an arm steady}

In our code, in @03-dynamics@ you find an example (rename
@main.problem.cpp@ to @main.cpp@). Please change
@../02-pegInAHole/pegInAHole.ors@ to @pegArm.ors@. You will find an
arm with three joints that is swinging freely under gravity (ignoring
collisions).

a) Apply direct PD control (\emph{without} using $M$ and $F$) to each
joint separately and try to find parameters $K_p$ and $K_d$
(potentially different for each joint) to hold the arm steady, i.e.,
$q^*=0$ and $\dot q^*=0$. Bonus: If you are successful, try the same for the
arm in @pegArm2.ors@.

Play with @setDynamicsSimulationNoise@ and check stability.

%% (Bonus) Try to use a PID controller that also includes the integral error
%% \begin{align*}
%% u = K_p (q^* - q) + K_d (\dot q^* - \dot q) + K_i \int_{s=0}^t (q^* - q(s))~ ds ~.
%% \end{align*}

b) As above, try to hold the arm steady at $q^*=0$ and $\dot q^*=0$. But
now use the knowledge of $M$ and $F$ in each time step. For this,
decide on a desired wavelength $\l$ and damping behavior $\xi$ and
compute the respective $K_p$ and $K_d$ (assuming $m=1$), the same for
each joint. Use the PD equation to determine desired accelerations
$\ddot q^*$ (slide 03:31) and use inverse dynamics to determine the
necessary $u$.

%Try this for both,  @pegArm.ors@ and @pegArm2.ors@.


%% \section*{Reading}

%% In the last exercise you tried to apply PD torque control directly on
%% each joint of a robot. That worked somehow, but
%% leads to a ``hanging'' and somewhat oscillating pose. Slides 04:19 and
%% 04:22 tell us how we can perfectly control the robot if we know its
%% dynamics.

%% Slide 04:19 shows how the dynamics of most physical systems (not only
%% robots) can be written in the form $M(q)~ \ddot q + F(q,\dot q) = u$,
%% where the mass matrix $M$ and the forces $F$ depend on the current
%% pose $q$ and velocities $\dot q$ of the robot. If we know the
%% kinematics of the robot and its mass distribution (inertial tensor for
%% each link), there exists an algorithm (Newton-Euler algorithm) that
%% can compute $M$ and $F$ efficiently; the details are not important.

%% The are two important consequences of this:
%% \begin{itemize}
%% \item If you know how you want to accelerate $\ddot q$ the robot, then
%% the equation $M(q)~ \ddot q + F(q,\dot q) = u$ tells you which torques
%% to apply on each joint.
%% \item We can now apply PD control on the accelerations instead of the
%% torque controls of the robot!
%% \end{itemize}
%% The latter means that we use a PD controller to determine the
%% desired acceleration of a joint
%% $$\ddot q_t^\text{desired} = K_p(q^* - q) + K_d(\dot q^* - \dot q)$$
%% and then use the system dynamics to compute the necessary controls
%% $u$. With this we annihilated all problems with external forces or
%% couplings between joints. Use this to solve the following exercise.

%% (Comment: Even if we don't know the robot's dynamics exactly, it is
%% usually better to approximate $M$ and $F$ roughly (e.g., using linear
%% approximation from the most reacent samples) and use the approximate
%% $M$ and $F$ together with PD acceleration control.)

%% \section*{Reading}

%% A PD controller can not only be used to stabalize a system around a
%% fixed target $q^*,\dot q^*$. It can also be used to follow a moving
%% target $q^*_t$, which is called a \emph{reference trajectory}. From a
%% given a reference trajectory $q^\text{ref}_{0:T}$ of joint angles only, we
%% compute the velocity as $\dot q^\text{ref}_t=(q_{t\po}-q_{t-1})/(2\tau)$ and the
%% acceleration as $\ddot q_t^\text{ref} = (q_{t\1} + q_{t\po} -
%% 2q_t)/\tau^2$. The last equation on slide 04:22 shows how we can use
%% PD acceleration control to follow such a reference trajectory. Use
%% this to finally solve the full-fleged, noisy, dynamic peg-in-a-hole
%% problem in the next exercise.

%% \exsection{The dynamic peg-in-a-hole problem}

%% In the exercise 3 you generated nice collision-free
%% trajectories for peg-in-a-hole using inverse kinematics.

%% a) Follow these reference trajectories using PD acceleration control
%% (slide 05:31) and thereby solve the peg-in-a-hole problem with a noisy
%% dynamic system.

%% b) Increase noise into the dynamic system (change to
%% @setDynamicSimulationNoise(2.);@). Record the trajectory of the 3rd
%% joint (@q(2)@) and plot it. Tune the PD parameters to get an
%% oscillatory behavior.

%% %% c) Keep the reference trajectory as is (assuming $q_0=0$) but perturb
%% %% the initial condition of the arm manually by changing the 3rd
%% %% joint. As above, record the trajectory of the 3rd joint (@q(2)@) and
%% %% plot it and play with the PD parameters to get the 3 types of
%% %% behaviors.
