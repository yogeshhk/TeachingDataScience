\exsection{Boyd \& Vandenberghe}

Read sections 1.1, 1.3 \& 1.4 of Boyd \& Vandenberghe ``Convex
Optimization''. This is for you to get an impression of the
book. Learn in particular about their categories of convex and
non-linear optimization problems.


\exsection{Getting started}

Consider the following functions over $x\in\RRR^n$:
\begin{align}
f_\text{sq}(x)
 &= x^\T C x ~,\\
f_\text{hole}(x)
 &= 1-\exp(-x^\T C x) ~.
\end{align}
For $C=\Id$ (identity matrix) these would be fairly simple to
optimize. The $C$ matrix changes the \emph{conditioning} (``skewedness
of the Hessian'') of these functions to make them a bit more
interesting. We assume that $C$ is a diagonal matrix with entries $C(i,i) =
c^{\frac{i-1}{n-1}}$. We choose a conditioning\footnote{The
word ``conditioning'' generally denotes the ratio of the largest and
smallest Eigenvalue of the Hessian.} $c=10$.

~

a) What are the gradients $\na f_{\text{sq}}(x)$ and
$\na f_{\text{hole}}(x)$?

b) What are the Hessians $\he f_{\text{sq}}(x)$ and
$\he f_{\text{hole}}(x)$?

c) Implement these functions and display them for $c=10$ over
$x\in[-1,1]^2$. You can use any language, but we recommend Python,
Octave/Matlab, or C++ (iff you are experienced with numerics in
C++). Plotting is oftem a quite laboring part of coding... For
plotting a function over the 2D input on evaluates the function on a
grid of points, e.g.\ in Python\\
\quad\begin{code}
\begin{verbatim}
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from mpl_toolkits.mplot3d import Axes3D

space = np.linspace(-1, 1, 20)
X0, X1 = np.meshgrid(space, space)
Y = X0**2 + X1**2

fig = plt.figure()
ax = fig.add_subplot(111, projection='3d')
ax.plot_wireframe(X0, X1, Y)
plt.show()
\end{verbatim}
\end{code}
Or in Octave:\\
\quad\begin{code}
\begin{verbatim}
[X0,X1] = meshgrid(linspace(-1,1,20),linspace(-1,1,20));
Y = X0.**2 + X1.**2;
mesh(X0,X1,Y);
save 'datafile' Y -ascii
\end{verbatim}
\end{code}
Or you can store the grid data in a file and use gnuplot, e.g.:\\
\begin{code}
\begin{verbatim}
splot [-1:1][-1:1] 'datafile' matrix us ($1/10-1):($2/10-1):3 with lines
\end{verbatim}
\end{code}

d) Implement a simple fixed stepsize gradient descent, iterating
$x_{k\po} = x_k - \a \na f(x_k)$, with start point $x_0=(1,1)$, $c=10$ and
heuristically chosen $\a$.

e) If you use Python or Octave, use an off-the-shelve optimization
routine (ideally IP-opt). In Python, scipy.optimize is a standard go-to
solution for general optimization problems.
