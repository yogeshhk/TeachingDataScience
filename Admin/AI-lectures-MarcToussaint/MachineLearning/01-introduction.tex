{\small
\item[] Notes: The \emph{prior} is both, a choice of representation
and, usually, a part of the objective function.

In Bayesian settings, the choice of model often directly implies
also the ``objective function''

\item Data alone is not enough
\item Overfitting has many faces
\item Intuition fails in high dimensions
\item Theoretical guarantees are not what they seem
\end{items}

\item Feature engineering is the key
\item More data beats a cleverer algorithm
\item Learn many models, not just one
\item Simplicity does not imply accuracy
\item Representable does not imply learnable

~\pause

\item Why is function fitting so omnipresent?
\pause
\begin{items}
\item Dynamics, behavior, decisions, control, predictions -- are all about functions
\item Thinking? ~ (i.e., planning, optimization, (logical) inference, CSP solving, etc?)
\item In the latter case, algorithms often provide the scaffolding, ML the heuristics to accelerate/scale them. (E.g., an evaluation function within a MCTS planning algorithm.)
\end{items}

}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\slide{ML$^0$ objective: Empirical Risk Minimization}{

\item We have a hypothesis space $\HH$ of functions $f:x\mapsto y$

In a standard parameteric case $\HH = \{ f_\t \| \t\in\RRR^n \}$ are functions $f_\t: x \mapsto y$ that are described by $n$ parameters $\t\in\RRR^n$

~

\item Given data $D=\{ (x_i,y_i) \}_{i=1}^n$, the standard objective is to minimize the ``error'' on the data
\begin{align*}
f^* \argmin _{f\in\HH} \sum_{i=1}^n \ell(f(x_i), y_i) ~,
\end{align*}
where $\ell(\hat y, y) > 0$ penalizes a discrepancy between a model output $\hat y$ and the data $y$.

\begin{items}
\item Squared error $\ell(\hat y, y) = (\hat y - y)^2$
\item Classification error $\ell(\hat y, y) = [ \hat y \not= y ]$
\item neg-log likelihood $\ell(\hat y, y) = -\log p(y \| \hat y)$
\item etc

\slide{What is Machine Learning beyond ML$^0$?}{

%% \item In large parts, ML is: \quad (let's call this ML$^0$)

%% \cen{\emph{Fitting a function $f: x\mapsto y$ to given data $D=\{ (x_i,y_i) \}_{i=1}^n$}}

%% ~

%% Beyond ML$^0$:

\item Fitting more structured models to data, which includes
\begin{items}
\item Time series, recurrent processes
\item Graphical Models
\item Unsupervised learning (semi-supervised learning)
\end{items}
{\small
...but in all these cases, the scenario is still not interactive, the data $D$ is static, the decision is about picking a single model $f$ from a hypothesis space, and the objective is a loss based on $f$ and $D$ only.

}

\item Active Learning, where the ``ML agent'' makes decisions about what data label to query next

\item Bandits, Reinforcement Learning, manipulating the domain (and thereby data source)
