# **DLL TRILOGY: MASTERING AGENTIC AI SYSTEMS**

## **A Practical Developer-Focused Training Series (Zero to Hero)**

---

### **PROGRAM OVERVIEW**
The **DLL Trilogy** — **Docling**, **LangChain**, and **LangGraph** — is designed for developers and startups who want to build **non-trivial LLM-based applications** without relying on high-end computing or cloud platforms.

This hands-on program helps participants understand how to parse multimodal data, design intelligent retrieval and agent systems, and automate agentic workflows end-to-end.  

---

### **WHO SHOULD ATTEND**
- AI and software developers exploring applied LLM development  
- Independent developers and small startups building on limited compute  
- Technical professionals interested in RAG, document intelligence, and workflow automation  
- Engineering and data science teams integrating open-source AI frameworks  

> ⚠️ This program is **not** suited for non-technical management or marketing professionals.

---

### **PROGRAM STRUCTURE**  
Each module runs **2–4 hours**, typically on **Saturday mornings** over one month.  
The final session is a **Capstone Project**, combining all three technologies.  

---

#### **MODULE 1: DOCLING – MULTIMODAL DOCUMENT PARSING (Week 1)**
- Understanding document parsing and structure extraction  
- Working with text, tables, and images in hybrid documents  
- Creating multimodal inputs for downstream LLM workflows  
- Integrating Docling with LangChain for RAG  
- **Workshop:** Building a parser for scanned PDFs and research papers  

---

#### **MODULE 2: LANGCHAIN – RAG AND AGENT DEVELOPMENT (Week 2)**
- Building context-aware LLM applications  
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) fundamentals  
- Implementing custom tools and chains  
- Designing autonomous agents for real-world tasks  
- **Workshop:** Building a RAG-powered AI assistant  

---

#### **MODULE 3: LANGGRAPH – AGENTIC WORKFLOW AUTOMATION (Week 3)**
- Introduction to agentic workflows and graph-based orchestration  
- Defining multi-agent collaboration pipelines  
- Using stateful execution for complex reasoning tasks  
- Integrating LangGraph with existing LangChain systems  
- **Workshop:** Automating multi-step business workflows  

---

#### **CAPSTONE PROJECT (Week 4)**
Participants will build an **end-to-end agentic application** that:
- Parses real-world documents  
- Uses retrieval for context-aware reasoning  
- Automates workflows with agent graphs  

---

### **LEARNING OUTCOMES**
- Build multimodal document parsers using open-source tools  
- Implement retrieval and agent systems with LangChain  
- Automate complex tasks using LangGraph workflows  
- Understand how to integrate LLMs into production environments  
- Gain the confidence to go from **Zero to Hero** in agentic AI development  

---

### **KEY BENEFITS**
- Hands-on, developer-focused learning experience  
- Real-world use cases and open-source tools  
- Step-by-step guidance with complete code samples  
- Capstone project for portfolio and deployment readiness  
- Flexible format: public, corporate, or conference-based sessions
