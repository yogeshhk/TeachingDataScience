# FROM ZERO TO HERO IN RAG

## A Comprehensive Training Program for Professionals

### **PROGRAM OVERVIEW**

Master the complete journey from Python fundamentals to end-to-end Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. This comprehensive bootcamp transforms software engineers with basic programming knowledge into RAG specialists capable of building intelligent document processing and question-answering systems that drive real business value.

### **WHO SHOULD ATTEND**

- Induction Batch: Recent graduates targeting AI engineering roles

### **PREREQUISITES**
- Basic programming knowledge (any language)  
- Understanding of basic data structures  
- Laptop with 8GB+ RAM, Programming setup  
- Enthusiasm to learn and build\!

### **PROGRAM STRUCTURE**
- Full-time mode: 
	- Daily: 8 hrs (morning 4 hrs for tutorial, afternoon 4 hrs for hands-on)
	- Week: 4 days for core topics, 5th day optional for advanced topic
- Part-time mode:
	- Weekly: Depending on your time, complete tutorials and hands-on assignments
	- Month: 4 weeks for core topics, Optional topics left to your interest
- For both modes:
	- Capstone project: after the learning days, end-to-end
	- Assessment: interview/presentation, GitHub, videos on social media
