Define a feature extractor: a feature for each word, indicating whether the document contains that word.

Now that we've defined our feature extractor, we can use it to train a classifier
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth,keepaspectratio]{class10}
\end{center}
To check how reliable the resulting classifier is, we compute its accuracy on the test set

We can examine the classifier to determine which features it found most effective for distinguishing the review’s sentiment 

\begin{center}

Apparently in this corpus, a review that mentions "Seagal" is almost 8 times more likely to be negative than positive, while a review that mentions "Damon" is about 6 times more likely to be positive.
