\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{What is Artificial Intelligence?}
Think of AI as:
\begin{itemize}
\item Teaching machines to be smart
\item Like training a very clever assistant
\item That never gets tired
\item And can remember everything
\item But needs YOUR guidance to work properly
\end{itemize}

\vspace{0.5cm}
{\bf In simple words:} Making computers do tasks that normally need human intelligence
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{AI in Your Everyday Life}

You're already using AI without realizing it!

\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf WhatsApp:} Suggests quick replies
\item {\bf Google Photos:} Groups photos by faces automatically
\item {\bf Netflix/Prime:} Recommends shows you might like
\item {\bf Gmail:} Filters spam emails
\item {\bf Facebook:} Shows posts you're likely to enjoy
\item {\bf Google Maps:} Predicts traffic and suggests routes
\item {\bf Amazon:} ``People who bought this also bought...''
\item {\bf YouTube:} Recommends next video to watch
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Banking and Shopping}
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf ATM Check Deposit:} Reads your check automatically
\item {\bf Credit Card:} Detects unusual purchases (fraud protection)
\item {\bf Online Shopping:} Personalized product recommendations

{\Large How Does This ``Intelligence'' Actually Work?}
\end{center}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Learning from Experience - Like Humans}

{\bf How you learned to cook:}
\begin{itemize}
\item First time: Maybe too salty or burnt
\item Next time: Adjusted based on what went wrong
\item After many attempts: You know exactly what to do
\item Now: You can even experiment with new recipes
\end{itemize}

{\bf AI learns the SAME way:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Give it many examples
\item It learns patterns
\item Gets better with practice
\item Can then handle new situations
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Real Example: Email Spam Filter}

{\bf Old Way (Before AI):}
\begin{itemize}
\item Engineers write rules: ``If email says FREE MONEY, it's spam''
\item Spammers change words to ``FR33 M0NEY''
\item Rules break, spam gets through
\end{itemize}

{\bf New Way (With AI):}
\begin{itemize}
\item Show AI 10,000 spam emails
\item Show AI 10,000 real emails
\item AI learns subtle patterns (not just keywords!)
\item Adapts automatically when spammers change tactics
\end{itemize}

This is why your Gmail spam filter is so good!
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Another Example: Voice Assistants}

When you say: {\em ``Alexa, what's the weather today?''}

\begin{itemize}
\item AI recognizes your voice (among all household members)
\item Converts speech to text
\item Understands you mean TODAY's weather, not tomorrow
\item Knows YOUR location automatically
\item Speaks response in natural language
\end{itemize}

All this happens in 2 seconds! Amazing, right?

{\Large Common Questions and Concerns}
\end{center}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{``Will AI Take My Job?''}

{\bf Honest Answer:} Some jobs will change, some will disappear

{\bf Jobs Most Affected:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Repetitive tasks: Data entry, assembly line work
\item Some customer service (chatbots)
\item Basic bookkeeping
\end{itemize}

{\bf Jobs Safe (and Growing):}
\begin{itemize}
\item Anything requiring human touch: nursing, teaching, counseling
\item Creative work: design, art, writing
\item Complex decision-making: management, strategy
\item Working WITH AI: new tech roles
\end{itemize}

{\bf Key:} Learn to work alongside AI, not compete with it
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Real Examples: Jobs Transformed}

{\bf Bank Teller:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Before: Processed transactions all day
\item Now: ATMs do basic transactions, tellers help with complex needs
\item Better job: More customer interaction, less repetitive work
\end{itemize}

{\bf Travel Agent:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Before: Book flights, hotels
\item Now: Websites do simple bookings, agents plan complex trips
\item Better job: Expertise-based, more interesting
\end{itemize}

Pattern: AI does boring parts, humans do interesting parts!
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{``Is My Personal Data Safe?''}

{\bf The Reality:}
\begin{itemize}
\item AI needs data to learn and improve
\item Your data = photos, messages, search history, purchases
\item Companies use this to make better services
\end{itemize}

{\bf What You Can Do:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Read privacy settings (yes, actually read them!)
\item Limit what you share on social media
\item Use privacy-focused browsers
\item Turn off location when not needed
\item Regularly delete search history
\end{itemize}

Balance: Convenience vs Privacy - YOU decide!
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{``Can AI Make Mistakes?''}

{\bf Yes! AI makes mistakes, sometimes serious ones:}

\begin{itemize}
\item Face recognition fails for certain skin tones
\item Language translators make funny (or offensive) errors
\item Self-driving cars can't handle all situations
\item Medical AI might miss rare conditions
\item Loan approval AI might be biased
\end{itemize}

{\bf Remember:}
\begin{itemize}
\item AI learns from data
\item If data has bias, AI will have bias
\item Always have humans check important decisions
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{``Will Robots Become Like Humans?''}

{\bf What you see in movies:} Robots with feelings, consciousness

{\bf Current Reality:}
\begin{itemize}
\item AI can seem intelligent but isn't ``conscious''
\item Doesn't have feelings, desires, or awareness
\item Can't truly understand context like humans
\item Limited to what it's trained for
\end{itemize}

{\bf Future:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Scientists debate if this is even possible
\item If it happens, it's decades away
\item For now, AI is a tool, not a thinking being
