\begin{itemize}
\item Note: A function may not be differentiable at every point; that is you might not be able to calculate the derivative for
every point on the function line. 
\item To be differentiable at a given point, the function must be continuous at that point, 
\item The tangent line at that point cannot be vertical, and the line must be smooth at that point 
\item Cannot suddenly change direction or have kinks

\textbf{Definition}
 Suppose that $f(x,y)$ is a function of two variables with domain $D$.  Suppose that $(a,b)\in D$.  Define $g(x)=f(x,y)$ and $h(y)=f(x,y)$.  Then we define the \underline{partial derivatives of $f$ with} \underline{respect to the variables $x$ and $y$} as follows.
 $$
 f_x(x,y) = g'(x), \qquad f_y(x,y) = h'(y).
 $$


\textbf{Fact}
\begin{eqnarray*}
  f_x(a,b) &=& \lim_{h\rightarrow 0} \frac{f(a+h,b)-f(a,b)}{h}    \quad \mbox{and} \\
  f_y(a,b) &=& \lim_{h\rightarrow 0} \frac{f(a,b+h)-f(a,b)}{h}.
\end{eqnarray*}  
 
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{}
\textbf{Notation}
\begin{eqnarray*}
  f_x(x,y) &=&  f_x = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial}{\partial x} f(x,y) = \frac{\partial z}{\partial x}= f_1 = D_1 f= D_x f, \\
  f_y(x,y) &=&  f_y = \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = \frac{\partial}{\partial y} f(x,y) = \frac{\partial z}{\partial y}= f_2 = D_2 f= D_y f. 
\end{eqnarray*}
  

\textbf{Example}
 Compute the partial derivatives with respect to $x$ and $y$ for the following functions.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item  $f(x,y) = x^4 + y^3 + 3xy$.
  \item $g(x,y) = \sin(xy)$.
\end{enumerate}

\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{}
\textbf{Note}
 Suppose that $f(x,y)$ is a function with domain $D$ and that $(a,b)\in D$.  Consider the curves $C_x : z= f(x,b)$  and $C_y : z=f(a,y)$.  The slope of the line in the plane $y=b$ which is tangent to $C_x$ at $(a,b,(f(a,b))$ is $f_x(a,b)$.  \\ 
 The slope of the line in the plane $x=a$ which is tangent to $C_y$ at $(a,b,f(a,b))$ is $f_y(a,b)$.  \\ 
 The equations of the tangent lines are 
 \begin{eqnarray*}
 \begin{cases} z-c= f_x(a,b) (x-a) \\  y=b.\end{cases} \quad \begin{cases} z-c= f_y(a,b)(y-b) \\ x=a. \end{cases}
 \end{eqnarray*}  
 They can be parametrized by the vector functions
   \begin{eqnarray*}
      r_x(t) &=& (a,b,c) + t(1,0,f_x(a,b)) \quad \mbox{and}  \\
      r_y(t) &=& (a,b,c) + t(0,1,f_y(a,b)).

\textbf{Note}
 We can of course consider the partial derivatives of functions of many variables.  Suppose that $f(\vec{x})$ is a function of the $n$ variables $x_1, \dots, x_n$.  Then we define 
 $$f_{x_i}(\vec{a}) = \lim_{h\rightarrow 0} \frac{f(a_1, \dots, a_{i-1}, a_i+h, a_{i+1}, \dots, a_n) - f(a_1,\dots, a_n)}{h}.$$
 We can of course use the rules of differentiating functions of one variable to compute these partials.
  

\textbf{Example}
 Compute the partial derivatives of $f(x,y,z) = x\sin(y)e^z$.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{}
\textbf{Note}
 We can of course consider higher derivatives.  The notation for the second order derivatives is as follows.
 \begin{eqnarray*}
 (f_x)_x &=& f_{xx} = \frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left( \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\right) = \frac{\partial^2 f}{{\partial x}^2},  \\
 (f_x)_y &=& f_{xy} = \frac{\partial}{\partial y}\left( \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\right) = \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial y \partial x},  \\
 (f_y)_x &=& f_{yx} = \frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left( \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}\right) = \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x \partial y},  \\
 (f_y)_y &=& f_{yy} = \frac{\partial}{\partial y}\left( \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}\right) = \frac{\partial^2 f}{{\partial y}^2}.  \\
 \end{eqnarray*} 
 The notation for third and higher order derivatives is similar.

\begin{frame}[fragile]  \frametitle{Linear Approximation}
  \textbf{Definition}
    Suppose that $f$ has continuous partial derivatives.  We define the \underline{linearization of $f$ at $(x_0,y_0)$} as
    $$
      L(x,y) = f(x_0,y_0) +  f_x(x_0,y_0)(x-x_0) + f_y(x_0,y_0)(y-y_0).
    $$
    The function $L$ is also called the linear approximation or tangent plane approximation of $f$ near $(x_0,y_0)$.

\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{}
  \textbf{Definition}
    The function $z=f(x,y)$ is  \underline{differentiable} at $(a,b)$ if the quantity $\Delta z = f(a+\Delta x,b+\Delta y) -f(a,b)$ can be expressed as
    $$
      \Delta z = f_x(a,b)\Delta x + f_y(a,b)\Delta y +\epsilon_1\Delta x + \epsilon_2\Delta y
    $$
    where $\epsilon_1,\epsilon_2 \rightarrow 0$ as $(\Delta x,\Delta y)\rightarrow (0,0)$.
   
  
  \textbf{Theorem}
    If $f_x$ and $f_y$ are defined and continuous near $(a,b)$, then $f$ is differentiable at $(a,b)$.

    approximate $f(.55,3)$.
    
  
  \textbf{Definition}
    Given a function $f(x,y)$, we define \underline{differentials} $dx$ and $dy$ to be independent variables.  We define the \underline{total differential} $\text{dz}$ as
    $$ \text{dz} = f_x(x,y)\text{dx} + f_y(x,y)\text{dy}.$$
   
  
  \textbf{Note}
    In the above expression, the dependent variable $\text{dz}$ depends on the 4 independent variables $x,y,\text{dx}$ and $\text{dy}$.
   
  
   \textbf{Note}
    If $f$ has continuous partials, then $f(x+\text{dx},y+\text{dy})\approx f(x,y) +\text{dz}$.

\textbf{Definition}
We define the \underline{directional derivative} of the function $f(x,y)$ at the point $(x_0,y_0)$ in the direction of the unit vector

$$
  D_u f(x_0,y_0) = \lim_{h\rightarrow 0} \frac{f(x_0+ah,y_0+bh)-f(x_0,y_0)}{h}.
$$
  

\textbf{Theorem}
If $f(x,y)$ is differentiable, then 
$$
D_u f(x,y) = f_x(x,y)a+f_y(x,y)b.
$$

\end{frame}



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{}
\textbf{Proof}
Define $g(h) = f(x_0+ah,y_0+bh)$.    \\ 
Then, we have that   \\
\begin{eqnarray*}
g'(0)&=& \lim_{h\rightarrow 0}\frac{g(h)-g(0)}{h} =
        \lim_{h\rightarrow 0}\frac{f(x_0+ah,y_0+bh)-f(x_0,y_0)}{h} \\ 
        &=&D_u f(x_0,y_0).
\end{eqnarray*}  
We can also write $g(h)=f(x,y)$ where $x=x_0+ah$ and $y=y_0+bh$.  \\ 
Applying the chain rule, we have,
$$
g'(h)=f_x(x,y)a+f_y(x,y)b.
$$ 
Thus, 
$$
D_u f(x_0,y_0)= g'(0) = f_x(x_0,y_0)a+f_y(x_0,y_0)b.

  If the vector $u$ is at an angle $\theta$ with the $x$-axis then we can write $u=(\cos(\theta),\sin(\theta))$.  Thus
