\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{SmolAgents at a Glance: Many Agents, One Framework}
      \begin{itemize}
	\item Unified framework with multiple agent types and capabilities
	\item Vision + Browser Agents interpret visual data and navigate web
	\item Code Agents write Python code as actions for complex tasks
	\item Tool-Calling Agents use structured JSON calls or text instructions
	\item Multi-Agents orchestrate multiple agents in hierarchical workflows
	\item Retrieval Agents use RAG to pull information from knowledge bases
	\item Built-in tools: web search, Python interpreter, speech-to-text
	\item Customizable tool functions enable real-world agent actions
	  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Code vs JSON: SmolAgent's Code-First Philosophy}
      \begin{itemize}
	\item Agents call tools by writing code instead of filling JSON schemas
	\item Traditional frameworks use structured JSON: \{"action": "Search", "input": "tutorials"\}
	\item Code-first offers full Python logic: loops, branches, complex operations
	\item Multiple tool calls in one go reduces iteration cycles by ~30\%
	\item Fewer reasoning steps while achieving better results than JSON approaches
	\item Code provides visible thought process, simplifying debugging
	\item JSON option available via ToolCallingAgent for simpler tasks
	\item Safety handled through secure interpreters and sandboxes
	  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Inside the CodeAgent Loop: How Does It Work?}
      \begin{itemize}
	\item Agent receives task and initializes system prompt with available tools
	\item LLM generates next action as executable Python code snippet
	\item Generated code runs and executes tool calls, returning results
	\item Results captured and appended to agent's conversation history
	\item Agent uses updated context to decide next action iteratively
	\item Agent calls final\_answer(answer\_text) when task complete
	\item Memory ensures continuity, prevents repetition and contradictions
	\item Error handling allows reconsideration when code bugs or failures occur
	\item Follows ReAct paradigm (Reason + Act) with code-based actions
	  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{ToolCallingAgent vs CodeAgent: A Quick Comparison}
      \begin{itemize}
	\item Both use same underlying multi-step ReAct logic
	\item ToolCallingAgent uses structured JSON calls for predictable interactions
	\item CodeAgent enables complex logic and multi-step operations in single thought
	\item ToolCallingAgent better for quick prototyping and safe environments
	\item CodeAgent superior for complex sequences requiring full programming
	\item Both accomplish complex tasks but serve different use cases
	\item Framework allows choosing between styles based on specific needs
	\item Code approach requires safety considerations but offers greater capability
	  \end{itemize}
