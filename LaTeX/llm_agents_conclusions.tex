\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Key Principles for LLM Success}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Focus on building the right system, not the most sophisticated one
        \item Progress systematically:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Start with simple prompts
                \item Optimize through comprehensive evaluation
                \item Add multi-step agents only when necessary
            \end{itemize}
        \item Core implementation principles:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Maintain simplicity in agent design
                \item Ensure transparency in planning steps
                \item Carefully design agent-computer interface (ACI)
            \end{itemize}
        \item Consider reducing framework abstraction layers in production
        \item Goal: Create powerful, reliable, and maintainable agents
    \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Challenges in LLM-Centered Agents}
  \begin{itemize}

    \item Finite Context Length: Restricted context capacity limits inclusion of historical information, detailed instructions, API call context, and responses.
    % \item System design works with limited communication bandwidth, impacting mechanisms like self-reflection.
    \item Long-term planning and task decomposition: LLMs struggle to adjust plans when faced with unexpected errors.
    % \item Planning over lengthy history and exploring solution space remain challenging for LLMs.
    \item Less robust compared to humans who learn from trial and error.
    % \item Reliability of Natural Language Interface: Current agent system relies on natural language as an interface, but the reliability of model outputs is questionable.
    \item LLMs may make formatting errors and occasionally exhibit rebellious behavior (e.g., refuse to follow an instruction).
    % \item Agent demo code often focuses on parsing model output due to these reliability issues.
  \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{When Not to Use Agents}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Avoid for \textbf{straightforward or infrequent tasks} requiring minimal automation.
    \item Traditional methods are more \textbf{efficient and cost-effective} for simple tasks.
    \item Unsuitable for tasks needing \textbf{deep domain-specific expertise} or complex knowledge.
    \item Examples: Legal analysis, medical diagnoses, or high-stakes decisions in uncertain contexts.
    \item Not ideal for tasks requiring \textbf{empathy, creativity, or subjective judgment}.
    \item Examples: Psychotherapy, counseling, or creative writing.
    \item Implementation demands \textbf{time, resources, and expertise}.
    \item May not be viable for \textbf{small businesses or limited budgets}.
    \item Challenges in \textbf{highly regulated industries}: Compliance and security concerns.
    \item Ensuring adherence to \textbf{regulatory requirements} can be resource-intensive.
