Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) consist of any two networks with one tasked
to generate content and the other has to judge content. The discriminating network
receives either training data or generated content from the generative network and
tries to predict the data source (real or fake). This creates a form of competition
where the discriminator is getting better at distinguishing real data from generated
data and the generator is learning to become less predictable to the discriminator.
