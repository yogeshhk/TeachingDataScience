\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Best Practices and Considerations}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Keep state models simple and clear with necessary information only
        \item Maintain single responsibility in node functions
        \item Handle exceptions and return new state objects
        \item Use clear conditional logic in edge design
        \item Avoid complex cyclic dependencies in workflow
        \item Add error handling at critical nodes with fallback mechanisms
        \item Consider performance impacts of checkpoint mechanism
        \item Choose appropriate data processing methods for use cases
      \end{itemize}
