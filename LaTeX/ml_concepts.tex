$Y= F(X_1, X_2,\ldots, X_p)$
\begin{itemize}
\item We have:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Observation of quantitative (numerical) response $Y$
	\item Observation of $p$ different predictors ${X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_p}$
	\end{itemize}
	\item Find function $F$ between $Y$ and $X = {X_1, X_2,\ldots, X_p}$
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{General Form}
As one may not get exact function $F$, approximate it to $f$, thus introducing some error.
\begin{itemize}
\item So, general form: $Y = f(X) + \epsilon$
\item $f$ is unknown function of ${X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_p}$
\item  $\epsilon$ is a random error term, Independent of X, Has mean equal to zero
% \item $f$ represents information that $X$ provides about $Y$
\item Statistical learning refers to approaches for estimating $f$

\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Estimate $f$}
\begin{itemize}
\item Not concerned if $f$ is linear, quadratic, etc.
\item We only care that our predictions are ``near accurate''.
\item So, $f$ often treated as a black box. 
\item The aim is of minimizing reducible error
% \item The irreducible error will always provide an upper bound on the accuracy of our predictions.

	\begin{itemize}
	\item Parametric

	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{How do we estimate $f$?}
\begin{itemize}
\item Parametric:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Assume that the functional form, or shape, of $f$ in linear in $X$, $f(X) = \sum_{i=1}^p \beta_i X_i$
	\item This is a linear model, for $p$ predictors $X = {X_1, X_2,\ldots, X_p}$
	\item Model fitting involves estimating the parameters $\beta_0, \beta_1,\ldots,\beta_p$
	\item Reduces the problem of estimating $f$ to estimating a set of parameters
	\end{itemize}
\item Non-Parametric: No explicit assumptions about the functional form of $f$
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Simple Example}
\begin{itemize}
\item Linear regression is a simple and useful tool for predicting
a quantitative response. The relationship between input
variables $X = (X_1 , X_2 , \ldots X_p )$ and output variable $Y$ takes
the form: $Y \approx \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \ldots + \beta_p X_p + \epsilon$
\item $\beta_0 , \beta_1 ,\ldots \beta_p$ are the unknown coefficients (parameters) which
we are trying to determine. 
\item The best coefficients will lead us to the best ``fit'', which can be found by
minimizing the residual sum squares (RSS), or the sum of the difference between the actual $i$th value and
the predicted $i$th value. 
\item $RSS = \sum_{i=1}^n = e_i$ , where $e_i = y_i - y'$
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{How to find best fit?}
Matrix Form:
\begin{itemize}
\item  We can solve the closed-form equation for coefficient vector $w$: $w = (X^T X^{-1}) X^T Y$. 
\item $X$ represents the input data and $Y$ represents the output data. 
\item This method is used for smaller matrices, since inverting a matrix is computationally expensive.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{How to find best fit?}
Gradient Descent:
\begin{itemize}
\item First-order optimization algorithm.
\item We can find the minimum of a convex function by
starting at an arbitrary point and repeatedly take steps
in the downward direction, which can be found by taking
the negative direction of the gradient. 
\item After several
iterations, we will eventually converge to the minimum.
In our case, the minimum corresponds to the coefficients
with the minimum error, or the best line of fit. 
\item The
learning rate $\alpha$ determines the size of the steps we take
in the downward direction.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{How to find best fit?}
Gradient descent algorithm in two dimensions (meaning with 2 features, as example):
\begin{itemize}
\item  Repeat until convergence.
\begin{align*}
w_0^{t+1} &= w_0^t - \alpha \frac{\partial J(w_0,w_1)}{\partial w_{0}}\\
w_1^{t+1} &= w_1^t - \alpha \frac{\partial J(w_0,w_1)}{\partial w_{1}}
\end{align*}
\item For non convex functions, gradient descent no longer guarantees an optimal solutions since there may be local minimas. 
\item Instead, we should run the algorithm from different
starting points and use the best local minima we find for
the solution.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{How to find best fit?}
Stochastic Gradient Descent:

\begin{itemize}
\item  Instead of taking a step
after sampling the entire training set, we take a small
batch of training data at random to determine our next
step. 
\item Computationally more efficient and may lead to
faster convergence.
\end{itemize}

	\item For highly sensitive test, 100\% sensitive, within the Negatives group, there is no mistake. 
	\item Meaning anyone who has tested negative, they surely don't have disease.
	\item All are truly negative. Meaning FN are 0. Recall thus can be made 1 by marking all positive. So there is no one in the Negatives group. So no FN. But thats not good.
	\item But still its not a perfect test, because within Positives, you may have some FPs.
	\item Similarly 100\% Specific test: We will send all negative tested guys to a different group. Within them we had FN guys as well. The Positives were perfect. All of them had disease. $FP=0$. So those who tested positive surely had the disease.

\item But you will also get more false alarms (lower precision). 
\item If you classify everything in the positive category, you have 100\% recall (no FN here), a bad precision because some of them could be wrong, so there will be many FPs, making precision lower.
\item If you adjust threshold strict so as to have good precision, you will have lower making of positives and mark many actually positive values as negative, falsely. Making more FNs, thus lower recall.

	\item In case of Machine Learning, there no iterations. How to detect Over-fitting in case of Polynomial Regression?
	\item Initially when, polynomial equation to start with is simple, it has not fit the data yet, so its under fitting phase. Losses are HIGH for both, training as well as testing (validation)
	\item As more levels get added in tree or more degrees in polynomial regression, under-fitting reduces and losses come down.
	\item At one point, training loss still reduces but validation los starts jumping up. Thats over-fitting. Model is fitting training data TOO tightly and is OFF the validation data.

% \item Raj, a seven-year-old kid, was just introduced to the concept of multiplication. He had mastered the tables of 1 and 2. His next challenge was to learn the table of 3. He was very excited and started to practice the multiplication table of 3. His table is something like this:
% \begin{lstlisting}
    % 3 x 1 = 4
    % 3 x 2 = 7
    % 3 x 3 = 10
    % 3 x 4 = 13
    % 3 x 5 = 16
% \end{lstlisting}
% \item Taj, Raj's classmate, was on the same boat. His table looked something like this:
% \begin{lstlisting}
    % 3 x 1 = 5
    % 3 x 2 = 9
    % 3 x 3 = 18
    % 3 x 4 = 24

% \item Error is normally distributed with zero mean and some variance: $\epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}\left(0, \sigma^2\right)$
% \item True value of the target variable is also normally distributed: $y \sim \mathcal{N}\left(f\left(\textbf{x}\right), \sigma^2\right)$
% \end{itemize}

% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% \begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Error Properties}
% The error at the point $x$ decomposes as follows:


% $
% \begin{array}{rcl} 
% \text{Err}\left(\textbf{x}\right) &=& \mathbb{E}\left[\left(y - \widehat{f}\left(\textbf{x}\right)\right)^2\right] \\

% &=& \mathbb{E}\left[y^2\right] + \mathbb{E}\left[\widehat{f}^2\right] - 2\mathbb{E}\left[y\widehat{f}\right] \\
% \end{array}
% $


% (For clarity, we will omit the notation of the argument of the functions.)

% Using formula $\text{Var}\left(z\right) = \mathbb{E}\left[z^2\right] - \mathbb{E}\left[z\right]^2$  or   $\mathbb{E}\left[z\right]^2 = \text{Var}\left(z\right) + \mathbb{E}\left[z^2\right]$ transform above equation to 


% $
% \begin{array}{rcl} 
% \mathbb{E}\left[y^2\right] &=& \text{Var}\left(y\right) + \mathbb{E}\left[y\right]^2 = \sigma^2 + f^2\\

% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% \begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Error Properties}
% By definition, variance is expected value of difference square:

% $
% \begin{array}{rcl} 
% \text{Var}\left(y\right) &=& \mathbb{E}\left[\left(y - \mathbb{E}\left[y\right]\right)^2\right] \\

% $\mathbb{E}[y] = \mathbb{E}[f + \epsilon] = \mathbb{E}[f] + \mathbb{E}[\epsilon] = f$
% \end{frame}


% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% \begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Error Properties}
% And finally, we get to the last term in the sum (original equation). Recall that the error and the target variable are independent of each other:
% $
% \begin{array}{rcl} 
% \mathbb{E}\left[y\widehat{f}\right] &=& \mathbb{E}\left[\left(f + \epsilon\right)\widehat{f}\right] \\
% &=& \mathbb{E}\left[f\widehat{f}\right] + \mathbb{E}\left[\epsilon\widehat{f}\right] \\
% &=& f\mathbb{E}\left[\widehat{f}\right] + \mathbb{E}\left[\epsilon\right] \mathbb{E}\left[\widehat{f}\right]  = f\mathbb{E}\left[\widehat{f}\right]
% \end{array}
% $

% Finally, let's bring this all together:

% $
% \begin{array}{rcl} 
% \text{Err}\left(\textbf{x}\right) &=& \mathbb{E}\left[\left(y - \widehat{f}\left(\textbf{x}\right)\right)^2\right] \\
% &=& \sigma^2 + f^2 + \text{Var}\left(\widehat{f}\right) + \mathbb{E}\left[\widehat{f}\right]^2 - 2f\mathbb{E}\left[\widehat{f}\right] \\
% &=& \left(f - \mathbb{E}\left[\widehat{f}\right]\right)^2 + \text{Var}\left(\widehat{f}\right) + \sigma^2 \\
% &=& \text{Bias}\left(\widehat{f}\right)^2 + \text{Var}\left(\widehat{f}\right) + \sigma^2
% \end{array}
% $
% \end{frame}


% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% \begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Error Properties}
% the last formula tells us that the forecast error of any model of type $y = f\left(\textbf{x}\right) + \epsilon$ is composed of:

% \begin{itemize}
% \item Squared bias: $\text{Bias}\left(\widehat{f}\right)$ is the average error for all sets of data.
% \item Variance: $\text{Var}\left(\widehat{f}\right)$ is error variability, or by how much error will vary if we train the model on different sets of data;
% \item Irremovable error: $\sigma^2$

\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{On a Lighter Note (Don't start imagining the individuals)}
A person with high bias is someone who starts to answer before you can even finish asking. A person with high variance is someone who can think of all sorts of crazy answers. Combining these gives you different personalities:
\begin{itemize}
\item High bias/low variance: this is someone who usually gives you the same answer (low variance), no matter what you ask, and is usually wrong about it (high bias)

\item High bias/high variance: someone who takes wild guesses (high variance), all of which are sort of wrong; (high bias)

\item Low bias/high variance: a person who listens to you and tries to answer the best they can (low bias, looks at lots of data), but that daydreams a lot and may say something totally crazy; (high variance)

\item Low bias/low variance: a person who listens to you very carefully and gives you good answers pretty much all the time.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{What is the trade-off?}
\begin{itemize}
\item Generally, as the model becomes more computational (e.g. when the number of free parameters grows), the variance (dispersion) of the estimate also increases, but bias decreases. 
\item Due to the fact that the training set is memorized completely instead of generalizing, small changes lead to unexpected results (over-fitting). 
\item On the other side, if the model is too weak, it will not be able to learn the pattern, resulting in learning something different that is offset with respect to the right solution.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{But Why is there a trade-off?}
\begin{itemize}
\item Low bias algos tend to be more complex and flexible e.g. Decision Tree (non-linear) so that it can fit the data well. 
\item But if the algo is too flexible, it will fit each training data set differently, and hence have high variance.
\item A key characteristic of many supervised learning methods is a built-in way to control the bias-variance trade-off either automatically or by providing a special parameter that the data scientist can adjust.
