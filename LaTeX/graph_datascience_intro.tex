\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{What's the problem?}

\begin{itemize}
\item History for every customer to generate personalized recommendations: Increases the problem of **sparse** and insufficient information
\item Reduce dimensionality by matrix factorization and content (word) embeddings: Only suited for content based recommendations
\item Macro level insights for cold start problem: Generates poor recommendations
\item Generating personalized recommendations is hard due to high dimensionality and sparse data sets
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{What's the problem?}

Take advantage of 

\begin{itemize}
\item graphs to capture the network structure
\item graph queries to store and retrieve relationships
\item graph algorithms to infer relationships
