\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Challenges in LLM-Centered Agents}
  \begin{itemize}

    \item Finite Context Length: Restricted context capacity limits inclusion of historical information, detailed instructions, API call context, and responses.
    % \item System design works with limited communication bandwidth, impacting mechanisms like self-reflection.
    \item Long-term planning and task decomposition: LLMs struggle to adjust plans when faced with unexpected errors.
    % \item Planning over lengthy history and exploring solution space remain challenging for LLMs.
    \item Less robust compared to humans who learn from trial and error.
    % \item Reliability of Natural Language Interface: Current agent system relies on natural language as an interface, but the reliability of model outputs is questionable.
    \item LLMs may make formatting errors and occasionally exhibit rebellious behavior (e.g., refuse to follow an instruction).
    % \item Agent demo code often focuses on parsing model output due to these reliability issues.
  \end{itemize}
