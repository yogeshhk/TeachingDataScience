%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Covariance}
Implement covariance, the paired analogue of variance.
The variance measures how a single variable deviates from its mean, covariance measures how two variables vary in tandem from their means.

\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Covariance}
Covariance is like a dot product and tell how two quantities (centered, meaning subtracted by Mean) are together/similar.

    """v_1 * w_1 + ... + v_n * w_n"""
    return sum(v_i * w_i for v_i, w_i in zip(v, w))

CoVariance 0.8

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Correlation}
Covariance is like a dot product normalized by standard deviation.
\begin{lstlisting}

	stdev_x = std_dev(x)
  	stdev_y = std_dev(y)
	if stdev_x > 0 and stdev_y > 0:
