\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Introduction to Agno Framework}
      \begin{itemize}
	\item Agno (erstwhile phidata) is a open-source, light-weight framework for building Multi-Agent Systems with memory, knowledge and reasoning
	\item Official documentation available at: \url{https://docs.agno.com/examples/introduction}
	\item Designed for for speed and efficiency and to build production-ready agentic systems with minimal boilerplate
	\item Agno exposes LLMs as a unified API and gives them superpowers like memory, knowledge, tools and reasoning.
	\item Supports 5 progressive levels of agentic system complexity
	\item Framework focuses on performance, reliability, and ease of use
	\item Built for both individual agents and complex multi-agent workflows
	  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Key Components}

    \begin{itemize}
	\item Agents: Think in terms of agency and autonomy:
	\item Tools: These are like plugins that give agents extraordinary abilities. 
	\item Memory and Knowledge: Remember past interactions and store relevant information, which allows them to have context and build on previous conversations
Agno also supports connecting to knowledge stores, like Vector databases, to enable retrieval augmented generation (RAG)
	\item Multi-Agent Orchestration: to create teams of agents that can work together
	  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{The 5 Levels of Agentic Systems}
      \begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Level 1:} Agents with tools and instructions - Basic autonomous task execution
	\item \textbf{Level 2:} Agents with knowledge and storage - Persistent data management
	\item \textbf{Level 3:} Agents with memory and reasoning - Context-aware decision making
	\item \textbf{Level 4:} Agent Teams that can reason and collaborate - Multi-agent coordination
	\item \textbf{Level 5:} Agentic Workflows with state and determinism - Complex orchestrated processes
	\item Each level builds upon the previous, enabling progressively sophisticated AI systems
