\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{What is AI?}
\begin{itemize}
\item AI stands for Artificial Intelligence
\item It's when computers and robots learn to do things that usually need human thinking
\item Like recognizing your face to unlock your phone
\item Or helping you find videos you'll love on YouTube
\item Think of it as teaching machines to be smart!
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{AI in Your Daily Life}
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Video Games:} NPCs (Non-Player Characters) that play against you
\item {\bf YouTube:} Recommends videos you might like
\item {\bf Smartphone:} Face unlock, voice assistants like Siri/Google Assistant
\item {\bf Netflix:} Suggests shows based on what you watched
\item {\bf Spell Check:} Fixes your spelling mistakes automatically
\item {\bf Google Translate:} Converts languages instantly
\end{itemize}
Can you think of more examples?

\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{How YOU Learn New Things}
\begin{itemize}
\item Remember when you learned to ride a bicycle?
\begin{itemize}
\item First time: You fell down (made mistakes)
\item Practiced more: Got better each time
\item After many tries: You can ride without thinking!
\end{itemize}
\item Same with learning math, cricket, or dancing
\item Practice + Mistakes = Learning!
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{How Computers Learn (Machine Learning)}
\begin{itemize}
\item Computers learn the SAME WAY!
\item Example: Teaching computer to recognize cats
\begin{itemize}
\item Show 1000 pictures of cats
\item Show 1000 pictures of dogs
\item Computer finds patterns (whiskers, pointy ears, etc.)
\item Now it can tell cats from dogs in NEW pictures!
\end{itemize}
\item This is called {\bf Machine Learning} (ML)
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\end{center}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Example 1: Ice Cream Sales}
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Simple Pattern:} When it's hot, more people buy ice cream
\item {\bf Relationship:} Temperature $\uparrow$ = Ice cream sales $\uparrow$
\item This is EASY to program with simple rules
\item No AI needed!
\end{itemize}

\vspace{0.5cm}
{\bf Rule:} IF temperature $>$ 30°C THEN more ice cream will sell
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Example 2: Video Game Player}
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Complex Pattern:} What's the best move in a chess game?
\item Too many possibilities to write simple rules!
\item Need to learn from MILLIONS of games
\item AI can do this!
\end{itemize}

\vspace{0.5cm}
How? By playing games over and over, learning what works and what doesn't!
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Example 3: Your Teacher vs AI Teacher}

\begin{tabular}{|p{5cm}|p{5cm}|}
\hline
{\bf Your Teacher} & {\bf AI Teacher} \\
\hline
Teaches 40 students together & Can teach millions at once \\
\hline
Works 6-8 hours a day & Works 24/7, never tired \\
\hline
Knows you personally & Remembers what you struggle with \\
\hline
Can explain creatively & Gives same answer every time \\
\hline
Can see if you're confused & Can't see your face \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\end{itemize}
\item {\bf Generative AI:} The creative one
\begin{itemize}
\item Can create NEW things: pictures, stories, music!
\item Example: ChatGPT, DALL-E
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Three Ways Computers Learn}

{\bf 1. Supervised Learning} (Learning with a teacher)
\begin{itemize}
\item Like learning with answer key
\item Example: Showing labeled pictures - ``This is a cat'', ``This is a dog''
\end{itemize}

{\bf 2. Unsupervised Learning} (Learning by yourself)
\begin{itemize}
\item Finding patterns without help
\item Example: Grouping similar songs together on Spotify
\end{itemize}

{\bf 3. Reinforcement Learning} (Learning by trial and error)
\begin{itemize}
\item Learn by rewards and punishments
\item Example: Game AI that gets points for winning
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Fun Example: AI in Video Games}
\begin{itemize}
\item Old games (1990s): Enemies move in fixed patterns
\begin{itemize}
\item Boring after you learn the pattern
\end{itemize}
\item Modern games: AI enemies learn YOUR style
\begin{itemize}
\item If you always hide behind walls, they throw grenades
\item If you snipe from far, they flank you
\item Every game is different!
\end{itemize}
\item This makes games more fun and challenging!

\item Example: Face recognition works poorly on dark skin (not fair!)
\end{itemize}
\item {\bf Cheating:} Using ChatGPT to do ALL your homework
\begin{itemize}
\item You don't learn!

\item {\bf Good:} Ask ChatGPT to explain a concept differently
\item {\bf Not Good:} Copy-paste ChatGPT's essay for homework
\item Always {\bf verify} information from AI
