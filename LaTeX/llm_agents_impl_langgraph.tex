\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{LangChain vs LangGraph – Why a New Approach?}

      \begin{itemize}
        \item LangChain excels at straightforward pipelines with fixed sequential tasks (retrieve → summarize → answer)
        \item Real-world workflows aren't always linear - they need branches, loops, and dynamic decision points
        \item LangGraph specializes in stateful, non-linear workflows within the LangChain ecosystem
        \item LangGraph exposes control flow explicitly, allowing fine-grained control over agent behavior
        \item You define a graph of possible steps instead of a rigid chain structure
        \item Agents can revisit nodes or choose different paths dynamically based on conditions
        \item Use LangChain for simple sequences, LangGraph for conditional logic and extended context
        \item LangGraph enables complex multi-agent systems with evolving task flows
      \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{LangGraph Fundamentals: Nodes, Edges \& State}

      \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Nodes (N):} Individual processing steps implemented as Python functions that transform state
        \item Each node encapsulates one sub-task: LLM calls, calculations, file operations, or tool invocations
        \item \textbf{Edges (E):} Directed connections determining execution order and flow between nodes
        \item Edges can be linear progressions or conditional routes based on current state
        \item \textbf{State (S):} Shared data object (dictionary/TypedDict) persisting throughout agent execution
        \item State enables context and memory across workflow, allowing nodes to read previous results
        \item StateGraph ties everything together with designated START and END nodes
        \item This approach handles interactive, conditional loops that static chains struggle with
      \end{itemize}

      \begin{itemize}
        \item Email processing assistant inspired by Alfred managing Bruce Wayne's inbox
        \item \textbf{EmailState:} Contains email content, spam flag, category, draft response, and message history
        \item \textbf{Five nodes:} read\_email → classify\_email → handle\_spam/drafting\_response → notify\_mr\_wayne
        \item Classify\_email uses LLM to analyze content and set spam status in state
        \item Conditional edge routes to spam handler or response drafter based on classification
        \item Handle\_spam terminates workflow early, drafting\_response continues to notification
        \item Demonstrates clear if/else logic through graph structure rather than buried code
        \item Successfully tested on legitimate and crypto spam emails with correct routing
      \end{itemize}
