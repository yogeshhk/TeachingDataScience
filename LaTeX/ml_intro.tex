\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{What is Learning?}
\begin{center}
{\em ``Learning is any process by which a system improves performance from experience.'' \\}
- Herbert Simon, Turing Award 1975, Nobel in Economics 1978.
\end{center}

% \begin{center}
% {\em ``Machine Learning is concerned with computer programs that automatically improve their performance through experience.''}\\

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{What is Machine Learning?}
Machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) which:
\begin{itemize}
\item Learns function without being explicitly programmed. 
\item Can grow and change when exposed to new data. 
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Quick Definition}
{\it Machine learning is a field of study that gives computers the ability to learn, without being explicitly programmed.}

- Arthur Samuel, 1959

So, rather than coding each step explicitly, you give computers just some examples, and it figures out the steps.
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Another Definition of Machine Learning}
Machine learning is manifestation of statistical learning: implemented through software.
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{WellPosed Definition}



{\it A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and some performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.}

- T. Mitchell's book Machine Learning (1997)

In the various problem settings T, P, and E can refer to completely different things. 
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Intuition}
\begin{itemize}
\item For any process (Machine ie Artificial or Biological), need to define a task, say Spam Detection. Machine can also do it and humans can also detect it.
\item Experience means multiple observations, runs, practices. So in our examples, its more Spam/Non-Spam examples.
\item Performance defined is How many we got right ie Accuracy.
\item Now if Task of Spam detection improves Accuracy if we look at more samples, then this is Machine Learning.
\item Its also called Inductive Learning (``Learning by Experience''). Based on evidence (not Facts), so its suggestive.
\item Another type is deductive (inferences based on facts/rules. So, more deterministic. Eg I went to Movie today. Today is Saturday. Inference: I went to movie on Saturday.)
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Intuition}
\begin{itemize}
\item Mitchell's definition, though looks OK for Machine Learning, its not very rigorous.
\item Contrary example: Say your task is Bike driving, experiences is more miles you drive, performance is smoothness of drive (vibrations).
\item As you put more miles, due to smoothening, performance improves (vibrations go down), is it Learning? 
\item No!!!
\item But for Machine Learning domain, it looks fine.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Tasks}
Tasks T in machine learning
\begin{itemize}
\item Classification of an instance to one of the categories based on its features;
\item Regression – prediction of a numerical target feature based on other features of an instance;
\item Clustering – identifying partitions of instances based on the features of these instances so that the members within the groups are more similar to each other than those in the other groups;
\item etc
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Experience}
\begin{itemize}
\item Experience E refers to data (we can't go anywhere without it).
\item For example, to predict loan defaults based on the data accumulated about our clients. 
\item Here, the experience E is the available training data: a set of instances (clients), a collection of features (such as age, salary, type of loan, past loan defaults, etc.) for each, 
\item And a target variable (whether they defaulted on the loan) is (1 or 0), 
\item This is a (binary) classification problem. 
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Performance}
\begin{itemize}
\item Metric of the algorithm's performance evaluation P
\item Such metrics differ for various problems and algorithms
\item A simple metric for classification algorithms, the proportion of correct answers – accuracy – on the test set.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{So, What is Machine Learning?}
\begin{itemize}
\item Ability of computers to ``learn'' from ``data''
\item Learn: Discover patterns, underlying structure  
\item Data: Comes from sensors, transactions, etc.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Goal of Statistical learning}
Dependent variables need to predicted or estimated in terms of independent variables.

	\begin{itemize}
	\item Data in control: independent variables.
	\item Data not in control: dependent variables.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Example}
 Goal: to measure sales based on the advertising budget allocated for TV, Radio, and Print.
\begin{itemize}
\item Can control: budgets of TV, Radio, and Print. 
\item Cannot control: how they will impact the sales. 
\item Express dependent (sales) as function of independent (advertising budget). 
\item Want to uncover this hidden relationship.
\item Statistical learning reveals hidden data relationships. 
\item Relationships between dependent and independent data.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Mathematical Definition of Machine Learning}
Machine Learning comes up with a Model given inputs and targets.

\begin{itemize}
\item Input data is available. 
\item Input data is transformed to get output.
\item Output: something that needs to be predicted or estimated.
\item Transformation engine is called Model or function.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Model entities}
For $income = c + \beta_0 \times education + \beta_1 \times experience$
\begin{itemize}
\item Inputs: Education and experience, also called as features or attributes or dimensions or variables.
\item Mathematical entities added to input data, are Parameters.. $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ are parameters
\item Income is target, also called as outcome or class.
