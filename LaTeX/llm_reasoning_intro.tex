directly using RL algorithm called Group Relative Policy Optimization 
(GRPO). GRPO does not need a neural reward model (value function).
        \item   DeepSeek-R1-Zero uses a rules-based reward system 
		\item Training uses two types of rewards:
		    \begin{itemize}
				\item   Accuracy Reward evaluates whether the model's response is correct.
				\item   Format Reward  enforces a desired format on the model's output.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item   GRPO is an RL algo used to train reasoning LLMs. 
        \item   While PPO uses a neural reward model (value function) to estimate 
rewards, GPRO generates multiple responses for each input prompt and 
uses the average reward of these groups of responses as a baseline.  
        \item   Uses KL divergence between current policy and a reference policy (a 
SFT model) into the loss function to ensure stable updates to policy.
        \item   GRPO needs less memory, compute, is stable and scalable.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{Reward Computation in GRPO}


    \begin{itemize}
        \item    Given a single input, model generates a group/batch of outputs
        \item    A pre-trained reward model trained on preference data is used to assign a 
reward to each output
        \item    Unlike PPO which computes an absolute reward, GRPO computes 
advantage of each response relative to other responses in the same batch. 
The average reward for the batch acts as the baseline for advantage estimation.
        \item     Then GRPO updates the policy using these relative advantages ensuring the 
responses with higher rewards are reinforced. KL divergence is the part of 
objective function to keep the policy close to a reference SFT model.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item     Like DeepSeek-R1-Zero, DeepSeek-R1 begins with DeepSeek-v3 as a 
base model. 
        \item     Then, DeepSeek-R1 undergoes four stages of training – 2 steps of SFT 
and 2 steps of RL
    \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{ Stages}



    \begin{itemize}
        \item   Stage One: SFT on Cold Start Data:  During this stage, R1 is trained on a small data set of pairs of prompts and the summaries of their corresponding long CoT reasoning (Supervised Cold Start Data) 
		\item Stage Two: Reasoning Oriented RL: In stage 2, large scale RL is used with additional reward for language consistency.  This language consistency reward improves the overall alignment of 
the resulting model with human preferences – making it more fluent 
and readable. 
		\item Stage Three: SFT on Diverse Data Examples:  In stage 3, another level of SFT is carried out on more diverse dataset. The SFT dataset for the stage 3contained 600K prompt-reasoning trails 
plus 200K non-reasoning prompt-response pairs.
		\item Stage Four: General-purpose RLHF:  In stage 4, RLHF is performed to align the model with human 
preferences.

Distilled Models from DeepSeek-R1

    \begin{itemize}
        \item   To create distilled models – the authors of DeepSeek-R1 began with two 
base models Qwen-2.5  and LLaMA-3. Then the base models were trained 
via SFT over 800K supervised training examples curated in 3 rd  stage of 
training pipeline for DeepSeek-R1. 
        \item  6 models were distilled from DeepSeek-R1 based on Qwen-2.5 and 
LLaMA-3 - (DeepSeek-R1 1.5B, DeepSeek-R1 7B, DeepSeek-R1 8B, 
DeepSeek-R1 14B, DeepSeek-R1 32B, DeepSeek-R1 70B)

    \begin{itemize}

language capabilities were not that great.

training process which resulted in DeepSeek-R1.

\begin{frame}[fragile]{ Trends}

Emerging Trends in Reasoning LLMs

    \begin{itemize}
        \item    Fine-tuning, reinforcement learning, and test-time scaling to 
optimize LLM performance. 
        \item    Long CoT (and inference-time scaling):  Using more compute at 
inference time—by generating a longer CoT— can allow users to 
dynamically improve a model’s reasoning capabilities.
        \item    Self-evolution through RL: Using large-scale RL training, the LLMs can 
execute complex reasoning strategies within their long CoT without 
explicitly being trained on this objective. 
        \item    Less human supervision: Reasoning models rely less on human 
supervision as compared to standard LLMs. Rewards during RL training 
are derived primarily from rules-based systems. 
        \item    Distillation: With large and powerful reasoning models, we can distil 
the capabilities of these models into smaller, dense models using 
simple strategies.
