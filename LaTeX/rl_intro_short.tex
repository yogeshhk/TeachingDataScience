\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Whats in RL?}

\begin{itemize}
\item   RL is not a new set of algorithms but a different way of structuring and solving problems. It is applicable only when such a structure is present.
\item   There are key entities in RL: Agent, Action, Environment, Reward, and States.
\item   The problem definition occurs within the environment. The environment consists of states, represented by variables. When an action is taken, the states change. A 'model' (if present) evaluates the favorability of the action and assigns a reward (positive or negative). After executing the action, the environment returns the new state variables and the corresponding reward.
\item   The Agent is the algorithm or strategy chosen to solve the problem. Various strategies can be applied to interpret the environment and maximize rewards. The agent selects actions it predicts will yield the highest reward. Initially, it takes random actions in a phase called Exploration. Once it learns which actions generally lead to favorable outcomes within the black-box environment, it transitions to Exploitation, where it prioritizes those actions for maximum rewards. These strategies, when implemented in code, are called Policies.

\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{What is Reinforcement Learning?}
Reinforcement Learning(RL) is a type of machine learning technique that enables an agent to learn in an interactive environment by trial and error using feedback from its own actions and experiences, to maximize cumulative rewards.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{The big picture}
\begin{itemize}
\item An agent (an AI) will learn from the environment by interacting with it (through trial and error) and receiving rewards (negative or positive) as feedback for performing actions.
\item Learning from interaction with the environment comes from our natural experiences.
\item Like, without any supervision, the child will get better and better at playing the game.

% \begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{RL Definitions}
% \begin{itemize}
% \item Reinforcement learning, a type of machine learning, in which agents take actions in an environment aimed at maximizing their cumulative rewards - NVIDIA

% \item Reinforcement learning (RL) is based on rewarding desired behaviors or punishing undesired ones. Instead of one input producing one output, the algorithm produces a variety of outputs and is trained to select the right one based on certain variables - Gartner

% \item It is a type of machine learning technique where a computer agent learns to perform a task through repeated trial and error interactions with a dynamic environment. This learning approach enables the agent to make a series of decisions that maximize a reward metric for the task without human intervention and without being explicitly programmed to achieve the task - Mathworks

% \begin{itemize}
% \item Interactive Learning within an Environment, like a student and a teacher
% \item Learning by trial and error, with adaptive control
% \item Goal is to build a policy-recipe for maximizing reward.
% \item Agent interacts with an Environment, with a feedback loop
% \item Agent finds optimum policy-strategy-recipe for making decision for better long term rewards.

% % \item Supervised ML learns the training data, tries to generalize it. But needs large amounts of labeled data.
% % \item Unsupervised ML also needs data, but unlabeled. Tries to find groups based on similarity.
% % \item RL does not need labeled data. It needs formulation for rewards and an Environment that can be poked. Maximizing Reward is the goal. Does not try to find pattern in the data (well, data is not there anyway).

% \begin{itemize}

% \item Differ in terms of their exploration strategies while their exploitation strategies are similar. 
% \item While Q-learning is an off-policy method in which the agent learns the value based on action a* derived from the another policy, SARSA is an on-policy method where it learns the value based on its current action a derived from its current policy.
% \item Both lack generality as they do not have the ability to estimates values for unseen states.
% \item Solution:  Deep Q-Networks(DQNs) which use Neural Networks to estimate Q-values. But DQNs can only handle discrete, low-dimensional action spaces.
% \item Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient(DDPG) is a model-free, off-policy, actor-critic algorithm that tackles this problem by learning policies in high dimensional, continuous action spaces. The figure below is a representation of actor-critic architecture.

% \item $\epsilon$-greedy policy
	% \begin{itemize}
	% \item	With probability $1-\epsilon$ perform the optimal/greedy action, otherwise random action
	% \item	Slowly move it towards greedy policy: $\epsilon \rightarrow 0$
	% \end{itemize}
% \item Agent can decide next Action based on, either
	% \begin{itemize}
	% \item Experiences so far (called Exploitation), or
	% \item just random (called Exploration)
	% \end{itemize}
% \item Till enough experiences are built, Exploration is used. Also, it can give a random twist, which brings generation, and unexplored paths.
