\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Models:} Building blocks supporting different AI model types - LLMs, Chat, Text Embeddings.
\item \textbf{Prompts:} Inputs constructed from various components. LangChain offers easy interfaces - Prompt Templates, Example Selectors, Output Parsers.
\item \textbf{Memory:} Stores/retrieves messages, short or long term, in conversations.
\item \textbf{Indexes:} Assist LLMs with documents - Document Loaders, Text Splitters, Vector Stores, Retrievers.
\item \textbf{Chains:} Combine components or chains in order to accomplish tasks.
\item \textbf{Agents:} Empower LLMs to interact with external systems, make decisions, and complete tasks using Tools.
\end{itemize}

% \begin{center}
% \begin{tabular}{|p{5cm}|p{5cm}|}
% \hline
% \textbf{Old (Deprecated)} & \textbf{New } \\
% \hline
% \texttt{LLMChain} & LCEL with \texttt{|} operator \\
% \hline
% \texttt{SimpleSequentialChain} & Chained LCEL runnables \\
% \hline
% \texttt{ConversationChain} & LCEL + Memory + Prompt \\
% \hline
% \texttt{RetrievalQA} & Custom LCEL RAG chain \\
% \hline
% \texttt{AgentType.ZERO\_SHOT} & \texttt{create\_tool\_calling\_agent} \\
% \hline
% \texttt{chain.run()} & \texttt{chain.invoke()} \\
% \hline
% \hline
% \texttt{langchain.schema} & \texttt{langchain\_core.messages} \\
% \hline
% \texttt{gpt-3.5-turbo} & \texttt{gemma2-9b-it}, \texttt{llama3-8b-8192} (Groq) \\
% \hline
% OpenAI imports & \texttt{langchain\_groq} imports \\
% \hline
% \texttt{VectorstoreIndexCreator} & Manual vector store creation \\
% \hline
% \end{tabular}
% \end{center}

% \textbf{Migration Steps:}
% \begin{enumerate}
% \item Update imports to new package structure (e.g., \texttt{langchain\_groq})
% \item Replace \texttt{LLMChain} with LCEL pipes
% \item Update deprecated model names to modern ones
% \item Replace old agent types with modern agent constructors
% \item Test thoroughly - behavior may differ slightly
% \end{enumerate}
