\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Models:} Building blocks supporting different AI model types - LLMs, Chat, Text Embeddings.
\item \textbf{Prompts:} Inputs constructed from various components. LangChain offers easy interfaces - Prompt Templates, Example Selectors, Output Parsers.
\item \textbf{Memory:} Stores/retrieves messages, short or long term, in conversations.
\item \textbf{Indexes:} Assist LLMs with documents - Document Loaders, Text Splitters, Vector Stores, Retrievers.
\item \textbf{Chains:} Combine components or chains in order to accomplish tasks.
\item \textbf{Agents:} Empower LLMs to interact with external systems, make decisions, and complete tasks using Tools.
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Migration Quick Reference}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|p{5cm}|p{5cm}|}
\hline
\textbf{Old (Deprecated)} & \textbf{New (2024)} \\
\hline
\texttt{LLMChain} & LCEL with \texttt{|} operator \\
\hline
\texttt{SimpleSequentialChain} & Chained LCEL runnables \\
\hline
\texttt{ConversationChain} & LCEL + Memory + Prompt \\
\hline
\texttt{RetrievalQA} & Custom LCEL RAG chain \\
\hline
\texttt{AgentType.ZERO\_SHOT} & \texttt{create\_tool\_calling\_agent} \\
\hline
\texttt{chain.run()} & \texttt{chain.invoke()} \\
\hline
\texttt{langchain.llms}, \texttt{langchain\_openai} & \texttt{langchain\_groq}, \texttt{langchain\_anthropic}, etc. \\
\hline
\texttt{langchain.schema} & \texttt{langchain\_core.messages} \\
\hline
\texttt{gpt-3.5-turbo} & \texttt{gemma-7b-it}, \texttt{llama3-8b-8192} \\
\hline
\texttt{VectorstoreIndexCreator} & Manual vector store creation \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\textbf{Migration Steps:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Update imports to new package structure (e.g., \texttt{langchain\_groq})
\item Replace \texttt{LLMChain} with LCEL pipes
\item Update deprecated model names to modern ones
\item Replace old agent types with modern agent constructors
\item Test thoroughly - behavior may differ slightly
\end{enumerate}

\begin{frame}\frametitle{Summary: Modern LangChain}

\textbf{Key Takeaways:}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{LCEL is the Standard}: Use pipe operator for all chains
