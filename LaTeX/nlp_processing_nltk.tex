\frametitle{ Regular Expressions for Detecting Word Patterns }
\begin{itemize}
\item Many linguistic processing tasks involve pattern matching. 
\item Regular expressions (RE) give us a powerful and flexible method for describing the character patterns we are interested in.
\item To use regular expressions in Python we need to import the $re$ library using: \lstinline|import re|

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth,keepaspectratio]{re1}
\end{center}
\item $re.search(p,s)$ is a function to check whether the pattern p can be found somewhere inside the string $s$.

Metamorphosis by Franz Kafka
\begin{itemize}
\item Book ``Metamorphosis'' by Franz Kafka
\item The full text for Metamorphosis is available for free from Project Gutenberg. http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5200
\item You can download the ASCII text version of the text here: http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/5200/pg5200.txt
\item Download the file and place it in your current working directory with the file name ``metamorphosis.txt''.

\begin{itemize}
\item The file contains header and footer information that we are not interested in, specifically copyright and license information. Open the file and delete the header and footer information and save the file as ``metamorphosis\_clean.txt''.

\item The start of the clean file should look like:

``One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin.''

\item The file should end with:

``And, as if in confirmation of their new dreams and good intentions, as soon as they reached their destination Grete was the first to get up and stretch out her young body.''

\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Some Observations}
\begin{itemize}
\item It’s plain text so there is no markup to parse (yay!).
\item The translation of the original German uses UK English (e.g. “travelling“).
\item The lines are artificially wrapped with new lines at about 70 characters (meh).
\item There are no obvious typos or spelling mistakes.
\item There’s punctuation like commas, apostrophes, quotes, question marks, and more.
\item There’s hyphenated descriptions like “armour-like”.
\item There’s a lot of use of the em dash (“-“) to continue sentences (maybe replace with commas?).
\item There are names (e.g. “Mr. Samsa“)
\item There does not appear to be numbers that require handling (e.g. 1999)
\item There are section markers (e.g. “II” and “III”), and we have removed the first “I”.

\frametitle{ Split into Words}
Splits tokens based on white space and punctuation. For example, commas and periods are taken as separate tokens. Contractions are split apart (e.g. “What’s” becomes “What” “‘s“). Quotes are kept, and so on.
\begin{lstlisting}
# split into words

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Filter out Stop Words}
Stop words are those words that do not contribute to the deeper meaning of the phrase.
They are the most common words such as: “the“, “a“, and “is“.
\begin{lstlisting}
from nltk.corpus import stopwords
stop_words = stopwords.words('english')
print(stop_words)

['i', 'me', 'my', 'myself', 'we', 'our', 'ours', 'ourselves', 'you', 'your', 'yours', 'yourself', 'yourselves', 'he', 'him', 'his', 'himself', 'she', 'her', 'hers', 'herself', 'it', 'its', 'itself', 'they', 'them', 'their', 'theirs', 'themselves', 'what', 'which', 'who', 'whom', 'this', 'that', 'these', 'those', 'am', 'is', 'are', 'was', 'were', 'be', 'been', 'being', 'have', 'has', 'had', 'having', 'do', 'does', 'did', 'doing', 'a', 'an', 'the', 'and', 'but', 'if', 'or', 'because', 'as', 'until', 'while', 'of', 'at', 'by', 'for', 'with', 'about', 'against', 'between', 'into', 'through', 'during', 'before', 'after', 'above', 'below', 'to', 'from', 'up', 'down', 'in', 'out', 'on', 'off', 'over', 'under', 'again', 'further', 'then', 'once', 'here', 'there', 'when', 'where', 'why', 'how', 'all', 'any', 'both', 'each', 'few', 'more', 'most', 'other', 'some', 'such', 'no', 'nor', 'not', 'only', 'own', 'same', 'so', 'than', 'too', 'very', 's', 't', 'can', 'will', 'just', 'don', 'should', 'now', 'd', 'll', 'm', 'o', 're', 've', 'y', 'ain', 'aren', 'couldn', 'didn', 'doesn', 'hadn', 'hasn', 'haven', 'isn', 'ma', 'mightn', 'mustn', 'needn', 'shan', 'shouldn', 'wasn', 'weren', 'won', 'wouldn']

\frametitle{Stem Words}
Stemming refers to the process of reducing each word to its root or base.
For example “fishing,” “fished,” “fisher” all reduce to the stem “fish.”

porter = PorterStemmer()
stemmed = [porter.stem(word) for word in tokens]
print(stemmed[:100])

There is a nice suite of stemming and lemmatization algorithms to choose from in NLTK, if reducing words to their root is something you need for your project.

\frametitle{Lemmatisation}
 Lemmatisation is the process of reducing a group of words into their lemma or dictionary form. It takes into account things like POS(Parts of Speech), the meaning of the word in the sentence, the meaning of the word in the nearby sentences etc. before reducing the word to its lemma. For example, in the English Language-
\begin{itemize}
\item beautiful and beautifully are lemmatised to beautiful and beautifully respectively.
\item good, better and best are lemmatised to good, good and good respectively.
\end{itemize}
\begin{lstlisting}
from nltk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer
lemmatizer=WordNetLemmatizer()

rp = nltk.RegexpParser(reg_exp)
result = rp.parse(pos_tags)
