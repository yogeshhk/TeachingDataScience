%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Step 6: Add User Interface}

        \item Use no-code tools like Lovable or Bolt
        \item Easily create interfaces without coding
        \item Great for user-facing agents and SaaS apps
      \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Step 7: Evaluate the Agent}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Skip fixed metrics-do error analysis
        \item Let performance metrics emerge naturally
        \item For RAG: evaluate retrieval and generation separately
      \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Bottom Line: Just Start}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Follow practical guides-many require no coding
        \item Use frameworks like n8n and tools like MCP
        \item Stop theorizing-start shipping real systems
      \end{itemize}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Business-critical systems require the right LLM strategy.
        \item Fine-tuning feels powerful, but often adds avoidable complexity.
        \item Start by exploring simpler and more flexible approaches first.

\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Pre-Fine-Tuning Checklist}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Can prompt engineering alone solve the task?
        \item Could Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) help more?
        \item Is there a clear and testable system already in place?
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Why RAG Outperformed Fine-Tuning}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Higher Accuracy}: Grounded answers from relevant context.
        \item \textbf{Fewer Hallucinations}: More reliable than fine-tuned outputs.
        \item \textbf{Dynamic Updates}: Easily update data without retraining models.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{When to Use Fine-Tuning}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item RAG can't solve context window limitations.
        \item Domain-specific tone or behavior is required.
        \item The system is mature enough to absorb added complexity.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Strategy Summary}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Prompt engineering solves 30--50\% of tasks.
        \item RAG adds power for another 30--40\%.
        \item Fine-tuning is best for the final 10\% of hard problems.
        \item Always choose the simplest effective approach first.
