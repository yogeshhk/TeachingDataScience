\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{When to Build AI Agents}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Don’t build agents for every task.
        \item Ideal for complex, ambiguous, high-value problems.
        \item Use workflows when decision paths are clear.
        \item Agents consume tokens—ensure value justifies cost.
        \item Avoid if error discovery is slow or high-risk.
        \item Limit autonomy when safety is critical.
        \item Use checklist: complexity, value, bottlenecks, risks.
        \item Coding is a great fit: complex but verifiable.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Designing Simple, Scalable Agents}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Every agent = Model + Tools + Environment.
        \item Start with extremely simple components.
        \item Avoid early complexity—hurts iteration speed.
        \item Reuse agent backbones for many use cases.
        \item Recombine code, tools, and prompts easily.
        \item Don’t optimize until behavior is stable.
        \item Visual clarity builds trust in the agent.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Optimization \& Performance}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Parallelize tools to lower latency.
        \item Cache action paths in coding agents to save tokens.
        \item Show step-by-step progress to build trust.
        \item Optimize costs only after validating core loop.
        \item Keep environments simple before scaling up.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Think Like Your Agent}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Agent only sees its limited context window.
        \item Don’t expect magic—expect bounded reasoning.
        \item Weird actions often mean missing context.
        \item Simulate tasks from the agent’s view.
        \item Debug using only the agent’s available info.
        \item Poor UI? Add metadata or improve resolution.
        \item Replay full trajectory—ask the model “why?”
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Tools \& Self-Improvement}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Define tools with clear inputs and expected outputs.
        \item Use the LLM to review tool clarity.
        \item Let agents self-critique prompts and tools.
        \item Build meta-tools that improve agent tooling.
        \item Better ergonomics reduce errors and retries.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{The Future: Multi-Agent \& Budget-Aware}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Solo agents dominate now—but not for long.
        \item Multi-agent = modular reasoning + parallel tasks.
        \item Sub-agents help preserve main context window.
        \item Async interactions beat synchronous limitations.
        \item Role-based coordination is the next big step.
        \item Budget-awareness = tokens, time, latency constraints.
        \item Define strict resource limits before deployment.
    \end{itemize}
