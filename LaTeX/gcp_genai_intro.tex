\textbf{Retriever:} Integrated IR mechanism for relevant snippet retrieval from documents. Implemented using term-based (keyword, TF-IDF, BM25) or vector search (dense embeddings).

\textbf{Generator:} Context (snippets) from knowledge base passed to LLM for well-formed response grounded in source documents.

Benefits:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Mitigates LLM limitations and unexpected behaviors.
    \item Avoids hallucinations by using relevant knowledge.
    \item Knowledge base updates maintain accurate and relevant responses.
\end{itemize}
