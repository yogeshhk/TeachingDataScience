	\item Eric Malmi: mines past rap songs and generates a new one based on similar rhymes and keywords, line by line.
	\item Start with a line from one rap lyric and ask the computer to search through the database for another line on the same topic that best rhymes. It then repeats this process for the next line and so on.

A human judge engages in a natural language conversation with two other parties, one a human and the other a machine; if the judge cannot reliably tell which is which, then the machine is said to pass the test.

\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Conclusion}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Deep learning has simplified feature engineering in many cases (it certainly hasn't removed it) 
	\item Less feature engineering is leading to more complex machine learning architectures 
	\item Most of the time, these model architectures are as specific to a given task as feature engineering used to be.
	\item The job of the data scientist will stay sexy for a while (keep your fingers crossed on this one).
