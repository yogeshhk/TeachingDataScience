			\item \textbf{Generative AI:} Great at understanding and generating content
			\item \textbf{Agentic AI:} Goes further, understands, generates content, \textbf{and performs actions}
			\item The key differentiator is the ability to \textbf{take action}, not just respond

\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{The Evolution of AI Capabilities}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Traditional Programming:} Needed code to operate
    \item \textbf{Traditional ML:} Needed feature engineering
    \item \textbf{Deep Learning:} Needed task-specific training
    \item \textbf{ChatGPT (2022):} Could reason across tasks without training
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Zero-shot learning (no examples needed)
        \item In-context learning (understands from instructions)
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Agents (2024):} Can actually \textbf{do things}, not just talk
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Why Does "Taking Action" Matter?}
\begin{itemize}
    \item In 2022, ChatGPT was revolutionary because AI felt conversational
    \item By 2024, people wanted more than conversation, they wanted \textbf{execution}
    \item Examples of what users now expect:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Instead of listing leads ? \textbf{email them directly}
        \item Instead of summarizing docs ? \textbf{file and create workflow tasks}
        \item Instead of suggesting products ? \textbf{customize landing pages}
    \end{itemize}
    \item This shift from \textbf{information} to \textbf{action} defines the agent era
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{How Do Agents Take Action?}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The magic lies in \textbf{tools} and \textbf{function calling}
    \item Agents are paired with APIs, plugins, or external systems
    \item Instead of just text responses, LLMs output structured commands:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item "Call the send\_email() function with these inputs..."
        \item "Fetch records from CRM using this query..."
        \item "Schedule a meeting for Tuesday at 2PM..."
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Mental model:} LLM = brain, Tools = hands
    \item Without tools, agents just talk. With tools, they act.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{What Is an Agent? (Technical Definition)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Agent acts and takes you from one state to another, providing value through workflow automation
    \item Based on ReAct paradigm: \textbf{Reasoning + Acting}
    \item Key capabilities:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Can plan and make decisions
        \item Has access to tools (search APIs, booking, email, etc.)
        \item Interacts with external environments and other agents
        \item Maintains memory of conversations and actions
        \item May include human-in-the-loop for safety
    \end{itemize}
    \item Agents existed since the 1950s but are now effective because of LLMs
\end{itemize}

            \item + Tools (hands)
            \item + Planning (strategy)
            \item + Memory (context)

        \end{itemize}
    \end{column}
    \begin{column}[T]{0.5\linewidth}
        \textbf{Business View:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Systems that complete tasks end-to-end
            \item Focus on outcomes, not components
            \item Solve real-world problems
            \item Provide measurable value
        \end{itemize}
    \end{column}
\end{columns}

\vspace{0.5cm}
\textbf{Important:} Today's agents are \textbf{engineering wrappers} around AI models, the intelligence comes from the LLMs, agents help act on that intelligence.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Generative:} Generate content like text and images
        \item \textbf{Agentic:} Execute complex tasks on behalf of humans
    \end{itemize}
    \item How do we empower every developer to build them?
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Co-Pilots:} Human-AI collaboration
        \item \textbf{Autonomous:} Independent task execution
    \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Building Agentic AI: Start with Problems, Not Technology}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Common mistake:} Starting with "Let's build an agent!"
    \item \textbf{Correct approach:} "What real-world problem are we solving?"
    \item Identify enterprise pain points first:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Support teams drowning in repetitive queries
        \item Analysts switching between dashboards for insights
        \item Sales teams manually logging customer activity
    \end{itemize}
    \item Design choices matter for enterprise applications
    \item Focus on agents that work in the real world, not just demos

\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Autonomy vs. Control: A Critical Trade-off}

		\begin{itemize}
			\item Key decision: How autonomous should your agent be?
			\item This is a \textbf{contextual trade-off}, not a one-size-fits-all decision
			\item Spectrum of autonomy:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item High human control ? Predictable, safe, limited capability
				\item High agent autonomy ? Flexible, powerful, potentially risky
			\end{itemize}
			\item Different problems demand different levels of agent involvement
			\item Consider: task complexity, risk tolerance, compliance requirements
		\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{When to Use Agents?}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Best suited for:} Tasks requiring flexibility and model-driven decision-making

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Monolithic models} are limited by training data

    \item Example: Vacation planning with no access to personal data
    \item \textbf{Compound AI systems} solve this by integrating multiple components
    \item External databases and tools enhance model responses
    \item Shifting from single models to integrated AI systems
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

    \item Systems are modular: combine models, tools, and databases
    \item Easier to adapt and quicker to solve problems
    \item Combining models with external components for enhanced output
    \item Example: Search query integrated with model for better accuracy
    \item Programmatic control logic guides the response
    \item Compound AI systems use system design for better problem-solving
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Role of Agents in Compound AI}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Agents use large language models (LLMs) for reasoning and planning
    \item LLMs break down problems into manageable tasks
    \item Slow thinking (planning) leads to better solutions
    \item Agents provide flexibility in solving complex tasks
    \item The agent's role is to manage logic and interact with tools
    \item AI agents improve with reasoning, acting, and memory components
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Components of LLM Agents}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Reasoning:} Break down complex problems into steps
    \item \textbf{Acting:} Use external tools like databases or calculators

\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Example: ReAct Agent in Action}
\begin{itemize}
    \item ReAct agents think slowly, plan, and act iteratively
    \item User query feeds into the agent with reasoning instructions
    \item The agent may call external tools and evaluate the results
    \item If the result is wrong, the agent revises its plan
    \item Example: Calculating sunscreen needs for a vacation
    \item Demonstrates the power of reasoning + acting paradigm
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Agent Autonomy in Problem Solving}
\begin{itemize}

    \item Complex tasks require agent autonomy for better flexibility
    \item Autonomy level depends on task complexity and need for iteration
    \item Agents are effective for complex, diverse tasks (e.g., GitHub issues)
