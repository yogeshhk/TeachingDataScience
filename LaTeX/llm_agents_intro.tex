  \begin{itemize}
    \item What are future AI applications like?
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Generative: Generate content like text \& image
		\item Agentic: Execute complex tasks on behalf of human
	 \end{itemize}
	\item How do we empower every developer to build them?:

\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Introduction to AI Agents}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item 2024 is expected to be the year of AI agents.
        \item AI agents combine multiple components to solve complex problems.
        \item Shifting from monolithic models to compound AI systems.
        \item Compound AI systems use system design for better problem solving.
        \item AI agents improve with reasoning, acting, and memory components. (ReAct = Reasoning + Acting)
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{What is an Agent?}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Agent acts, take you from one state to the other state, provides value by workflow automation. (ReAct paper: Reasoning and Action), it can plan and make decisions.
		\item Agents have access to tools (ToolFormer paper) e.g. Search APIs, booking, send email etc.
		\item Interacting of external environment and other Agents, etc.
		\item Memory to keep the history of conversations/actions done so far.
		\item May have human-in-loop to keep it sane in the wild-world.
		\item Agents were there from 1950's but they are effective because of LLMs.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{What are Agents?}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Agents are systems where LLMs dynamically direct their own processes and tool usage
        \item Can operate autonomously over extended periods using various tools
        \item Distinct from workflows: agents have dynamic control vs. predefined code paths
        \item Essential component in modern AI systems with varying degrees of autonomy
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{The Evolution of AI Capabilities}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Traditional Programming:} Needed code to operate
    \item \textbf{Traditional ML:} Needed feature engineering
    \item \textbf{Deep Learning:} Needed task-specific training
    \item \textbf{ChatGPT (2022):} Could reason across tasks without training
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Zero-shot learning (no examples needed)
        \item In-context learning (understands from instructions)
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Agents (2024):} Can actually \textbf{do things}, not just talk
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Why Does "Taking Action" Matter?}
\begin{itemize}
    \item In 2022, ChatGPT was revolutionary because AI felt conversational
    \item By 2024, people wanted more than conversation, they wanted \textbf{execution}
    \item Examples of what users now expect:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Instead of listing leads ? \textbf{email them directly}
        \item Instead of summarizing docs ? \textbf{file and create workflow tasks}
        \item Instead of suggesting products ? \textbf{customize landing pages}
    \end{itemize}
    \item This shift from \textbf{information} to \textbf{action} defines the agent era
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{How Do Agents Take Action?}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The magic lies in \textbf{tools} and \textbf{function calling}
    \item Agents are paired with APIs, plugins, or external systems
    \item Instead of just text responses, LLMs output structured commands:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item "Call the send\_email() function with these inputs..."
        \item "Fetch records from CRM using this query..."
        \item "Schedule a meeting for Tuesday at 2PM..."
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Mental model:} LLM = brain, Tools = hands
    \item Without tools, agents just talk. With tools, they act.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Defining AI Agents with an example}

      \begin{itemize}
		\item Planning a trip involves many complex tasks
		\item Point A: Just discussing the trip
		\item Point B: All bookings and itinerary ready
		\item AI Agents aim to take you from A to B
		\item First idea: Agent adds value by saving time/money
      \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Evolving Definition of Agents}

      \begin{itemize}
		\item Not all tools from A to B are agents (e.g., cars)
		\item Agents must plan and make decisions
		\item Second definition includes decision-making ability
		\item Example: Choosing flights based on budget
		\item Planning daily itinerary needs contextual judgment
      \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Agents Need Tools}

      \begin{itemize}
        \item Even self-driving cars plan but are not agents
        \item Agents need access to external tools
        \item Tools = Access to services (e.g., Gmail, Booking)
        \item Agents perform tasks using these tools
        \item Third definition adds tool access to capabilities
      \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Rise of LLMs in Agents}

      \begin{itemize}
        \item Transformers (2017) enabled powerful LLMs
        \item LLMs understand and generate human language
        \item Agents use LLMs for reasoning and planning
        \item LLMs enable understanding of webpages and writing emails
        \item Fourth definition: Agents are LLMs with tools and planning ability

    \item Key capabilities:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Can plan and make decisions
        \item Has access to tools (search APIs, booking, email, etc.)
        \item Interacts with external environments and other agents
        \item Maintains memory of conversations and actions
        \item May include human-in-the-loop for safety

        \textbf{Technical View:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item LLM (brain)
            \item + Tools (hands)
            \item + Planning (strategy)
            \item + Memory (context)
            \item + State management
        \end{itemize}
    \end{column}
    \begin{column}[T]{0.5\linewidth}
        \textbf{Business View:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Systems that complete tasks end-to-end
            \item Focus on outcomes, not components
            \item Solve real-world problems
            \item Provide measurable value
        \end{itemize}
    \end{column}
\end{columns}

\vspace{0.5cm}
\textbf{Important:} Today's agents are \textbf{engineering wrappers} around AI models, the intelligence comes from the LLMs, agents help act on that intelligence.
