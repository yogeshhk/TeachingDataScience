\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{So, what is MCP?}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item A standardized way to deliver full context to an LLM
        \item Includes task, tools, memory, documents, and prior messages
        \item Acts like a structured input package for the model
        \item Similar to protocols like HTTP or TCP/IP — not a product
        \item Enables clean communication between model and system
      \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Why MCP Matters}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Avoids reinventing prompt logic for every use case
        \item Standardizes context delivery for agents
        \item Simplifies managing memory, tools, and state
        \item Enables modular, composable orchestration
        \item Think of it as a structured request schema for LLMs
      \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{How MCP Helps in Practice}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Reduces chaos in multi-tool, multi-context systems
        \item Makes integration with RAG, memory, and outputs cleaner
        \item Easier to plug agents into enterprise pipelines
        \item Moves away from dumping long prompts into the model
        \item Structured text input improves grounding and clarity
      \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Why MCP Gained Traction}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item AI-native: designed for agents, tools, memory, and more
        \item Strong initial documentation and real examples
        \item Released SDKs, testing tools, and demos
        \item Quiet launch in 2024; exploded in 2025 adoption
        \item Broad support from OpenAI, startups, and platforms
      \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Common Misunderstandings}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item MCP is not a new API or product
        \item It doesn’t make models smarter — just clearer context
        \item Useful beyond agents — assistants benefit too
        \item Helps structure evolving context, not static prompts
      \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Should You Care About MCP?}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Not essential for simple demos or toy prompts
        \item Crucial for enterprise-grade agent systems
        \item Helps with multi-tool, RAG, memory, and planning workflows
        \item Improves long-term context management and scale
        \item Adoption is key — like any protocol, usage defines value
      \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Some Opposition to MCP \ldots}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Fancy acronyms often solve imaginary problems
        \item Overengineered MCP layers complicate agent-API flow
        \item Hype drives architecture-not actual needs
        \item Direct API calls are faster and clearer
        \item Lower latency and reduced system complexity
        \item Easier to debug, scale, and maintain	
		\item Skip the MCP if your API already works
        \item Avoid unnecessary layers for trend's sake
        \item Prioritize shipping over architecture theater
    \end{itemize}
