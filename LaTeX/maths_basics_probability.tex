\begin{frame}{Why Probability?}
\begin{itemize}
\item Real life scenarios are inherently random or too complex to be completely known. 
\item If you knew every ``Physics'' aspect of motion of a dice, you could predict the outcome, deterministically.
\item However this can never be done in practice, so there is a CHANCE of something happening.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Probability: the Likeliness}
\begin{itemize}
\item How likely something is to happen. 
\item Many events can't be predicted with total certainty. 
\item The best we can say is how likely they are to happen, using the idea of probability. 
\item Probability is the fraction of time that outcome would occur with repeated experiments.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Probability: Example}
\begin{itemize}
\item Probability (event ) = Number of ways it can happen / Total number of 
outcomes 
\item Example: the chances of rolling a ``4'' with a die 
\item Number of ways it can happen: 1 (there is only 1 face with a ``4'' on it) 
\item Total number of outcomes: 6 (there are 6 faces altogether) 
 \item Probability of  this event  = 1/ 6 
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Probability: Example}
\begin{itemize}
\item There are 5 marbles in a bag: 4 are blue, and 1 is red. 
\item What is the probability that a blue marble gets picked? 
\item Number of ways it can happen: 4 (there are 4 blues) 
\item Total number of outcomes: 5 (there are 5 marbles in total) 
 
\item Probability of  this event  = 4 / 5 
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Probability: Example}
\begin{itemize}
\item Flip 3 coins. What is the probability that we get exactly two heads?
\item Flip 1 coin, you get either H or T. Then flip 2nd coin, draw further branches (like below)
\item At the end you will have 8 possible outcomes
\begin{center}

\item What we want are HHT, HTH, THH. So 3 out of 8. 
\item Probability of  this event  = 3 / 8

\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Probability} 
\begin{definition}
Given an experiment, let $S$ be the set of all possible outcomes ($S$ is often called the \underline{sample space}) and $A$ be the event of some particular outcomes (so $A\subseteq S$).  The probability of $A$, denoted by $P(A)$, is the relative proportion of $A$ in $S$.
\end{definition}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Probability} 
\begin{example}
Suppose we are rolling a fair die, then $S=\{1,2,3,4,5,6\}$.  Let $A$ be the event that the outcome is an even number, that is, $A=\{2,4,6\}$.  Then $P(A)= 1/2$.
\end{example}

\begin{example}
Suppose we are rolling two fair dice, and let $A$ be the event that the sum of outcomes is either 6 or 7.  Then $P(A)= 11/35$.
\end{example}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Some terminologies }
\begin{itemize}
\item Experiment or Trial: an action where the result is uncertain. Example: Tossing a coin, throwing dice are examples of experiments. 
\item Outcome: A single possibility from the experiment. E.g. $\Omega = {HHT, THT, \ldots}$, each of these are outcomes.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Event}
\begin{itemize}
\item Event: a set of outcomes/results of an experiment 
 \item An event is what we are looking for ue $E={ExactlyTwoHeads}$. E is any subset of the sample space. The set of all events associated with a given
experiment is called the event space.
\item Example Events: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Getting a Tail when tossing a coin is an event 

\item Rolling a ''5'' is an event. 
\end{itemize}
\item An event can include one or more possible outcomes: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Choosing a ''King'' from a deck of cards (any of the 4 Kings) is an 
event 
\item Rolling an ''even number'' (2, 4 or 6) is also an event 
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Sample space }
\begin{itemize}
\item  
Sample Space: all the possible outcomes of an experiment. Example: choosing a card from a deck 
\begin{itemize}
\item There are 52 cards in a deck (not including Jokers) 
\item So  the  Sample  Space  is  all  52  possible  cards:  {Ace  of  Hearts,  2  of 
Hearts, etc. } 
\end{itemize}
\item A Sample Point is just one possible outcome. 
\item And an Event can be one or more of the possible outcomes. 
\item Flipping the coin:  the sample space is  $\{H,T\}$.

\item Whats the sample space of number of heads if we flip a coin 10 times?

\item $\{0,1,\ldots,10\}$

\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Probability of an event? }
\begin{itemize}
\item  Both `event' and `probability' are intuitively understood by most 
people, but we need to establish certain rules. 
\item  `Rain tomorrow', `3 or fewer cyclones next year', `Crop yield will 
exceed a given threshold' are  all examples of `events' whose 
`probabilities' might be of interest.

%If we choose a real number $x$ from the interval $[0,5]$, what is the probability that $2\leq x \leq 4$?  In this case, $S=[0,5]$ and $A=[2,4]$.  It follows that $P(A)= 2/5$.

%If we choose a point from the square above, the probability that the point belongs to the shaded region equals  $\frac{(2r)^2-\pi r^2}{(2r)^2}= 1-\frac{\pi}{4}= 0.215$.

\begin{frame}{Axioms* of Probability}
\begin{itemize}
\item Probability is between 0 and 1. ie $P(E) \in [0,1]$
\item Outcome is always from the sample space.
\item Summation of probabilities of all possible outcomes is 1
\end{itemize}

* Axioms are statements considered to be true without any proof.
\end{frame}



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Properties of Probability}
Let $S$ be the sample space and $A,B$ be events.  Then
\begin{itemize}
\item $P(S)=1, P(\emptyset)=0$. 
\item If $A\subseteq B$, then $P(A)\leq P(B)$.  In particular, $0\leq P(A)\leq 1$. 
\item $P(A\cup B)=P(A)+P(B)-P(A\cap B)$.  In particular, if $A$ and $B$ are disjoint, then $P(A
\cup B)=P(A)+P(B)$. 
\item $P(A^c)=1-P(A)$.
