\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Sentiment Analysis}

Sentiment analysis involves analyzing a text to determine the sentiment, whether it is positive, negative, or neutral. 

{\tiny (Ref: LangChain: New NLP/NLU Shining Armor - Sandeep Singh)}

\begin{lstlisting}
from langchain import LangChain

# Initialize LangChain object
lc = LangChain()

# Define input text
input_text = "I love LangChain! It's the best NLP library I've ever used."

# Perform sentiment analysis
sentiment = lc.sentiment(input_text)

# Print the sentiment
print(sentiment)
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Named Entity Recognition (NER)}

Named Entity Recognition is the process of identifying and categorizing named entities such as people, places, organizations, and dates in text data.

{\tiny (Ref: LangChain: New NLP/NLU Shining Armor - Sandeep Singh)}

\begin{lstlisting}
from langchain import LangChain

# Initialize LangChain object
lc = LangChain()

# Define input text
input_text = "Microsoft is acquiring Nuance Communications for $19.7 billion."

# Perform NER
entities = lc.ner(input_text)

# Print the entities

\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Text Summarization}

Text summarization is the process of reducing a text document to a shorter version while retaining its most important information.

{\tiny (Ref: LangChain: New NLP/NLU Shining Armor - Sandeep Singh)}

\begin{lstlisting}
from langchain import LangChain

# Initialize LangChain object
lc = LangChain()
input_text = "In recent years, natural language processing (NLP) has seen quick progress and significant breakthroughs in various domains, including machine translation, sentiment analysis, and text summarization. Text summarization is the process of reducing a text document to a shorter version while retaining its most important information. There are two types of text summarization: extractive and abstractive. Extractive summarization involves selecting important sentences or phrases from the original document, while abstractive summarization involves generating new sentences to summarize the content."
max_length = 50

summary = lc.summarize(input_text, max_length)
print(summary)

\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging}

Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging is the process of identifying and tagging the part of speech of each word in a sentence. 

{\tiny (Ref: LangChain: New NLP/NLU Shining Armor - Sandeep Singh)}

\begin{lstlisting}
from langchain import LangChain

# Initialize LangChain object
lc = LangChain()

# Define input text
input_text = "I am learning natural language processing using LangChain."

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Text Similarity}

Text similarity is the process of measuring how similar two pieces of text are to each other.

{\tiny (Ref: LangChain: New NLP/NLU Shining Armor - Sandeep Singh)}

\begin{lstlisting}
from langchain import LangChain

# Initialize LangChain object
lc = LangChain()

# Define two input texts
input_text1 = "I love playing basketball."
input_text2 = "Basketball is my favorite sport."

# Compute text similarity
similarity = lc.text_similarity(input_text1, input_text2)

# Print the similarity score
print(similarity)
\end{lstlisting}	  

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Language Detection}

Language detection is the process of identifying the language of a given text.

{\tiny (Ref: LangChain: New NLP/NLU Shining Armor - Sandeep Singh)}

\begin{lstlisting}
from langchain import LangChain

# Initialize LangChain object
lc = LangChain()

# Define input text
input_text = "Bonjour, comment ca va?"

# Perform language detection
language = lc.detect_language(input_text)

# Print the detected language
print(language)
\end{lstlisting}	  

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Text Generation}

Text generation is the process of generating new text based on a given input or context. 

{\tiny (Ref: LangChain: New NLP/NLU Shining Armor - Sandeep Singh)}

\begin{lstlisting}
from langchain import LangChain

# Initialize LangChain object
lc = LangChain()

# Define input context
input_context = "The quick brown fox jumps over the"

# Generate new text
generated_text = lc.generate_text(input_context, length=50)

# Print the generated text
print(generated_text)
