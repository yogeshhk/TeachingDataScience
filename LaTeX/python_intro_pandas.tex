\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Pandas}	
\textbf{\textit{pandas}} introduces two new data structures to Python - \textbf{Series} and \textbf{DataFrame}, both of which are built on top of NumPy.
\begin{lstlisting}
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
pd.set_option('max_columns', 50)
\end{lstlisting}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Series}
Series is a one-dimensional labeled array capable of holding any data type (integers, strings, floating point numbers, Python objects, etc.). The axis labels are collectively referred to as the index. The basic method to create a Series is to call:
\begin{lstlisting}
s = Series(data, index=index)
\end{lstlisting}
 Here, data can be many different things:
\begin{itemize}
\item a Python \texttt{dict}
\item an \texttt{ndarray}
\item a scalar value (like 5)
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]
\begin{itemize}
\item A Series is a one-dimensional object similar to an array, list, or column in a table. 
\item It will assign a labeled index to each item in the Series. \item By default, each item will receive an index label from 0 to N, where N is the length of the Series minus one.
\end{itemize}
\begin{lstlisting}
# create a Series with an arbitrary list
s = pd.Series([7, 'Heisenberg', 3.14, -1789710578,     'Happy Eating!'])
s
\end{lstlisting}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Series}
\textbf{Output from Previous Slide}
\begin{lstlisting}
0                7
1       Heisenberg
2             3.14
3      -1789710578
4    Happy Eating!
dtype: object
\end{lstlisting}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]
Alternatively, you can specify an index to use when creating the Series.
\begin{lstlisting}
s = pd.Series([7, 'Heisenberg', 3.14, -1789710578, 
   'Happy Eating!'],
index=['A', 'Z', 'C', 'Y', 'E'])
s
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{lstlisting}
A                7
Z       Heisenberg
C             3.14
Y      -1789710578
E    Happy Eating!
dtype: object
\end{lstlisting}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Series}		
The Series constructor can convert a dictonary as well, using the keys of the dictionary as its index.
\begin{lstlisting}
d = {'Chicago': 1000, 'New York': 1300, 'Portland': 900, 'San Francisco': 1100,'Austin': 450, 'Boston': None}
cities = pd.Series(d)
cities
Out[4]:
Austin            450
Boston            NaN
Chicago          1000
New York         1300
Portland          900
San Francisco    1100
dtype: float64
\end{lstlisting}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Series}		
You can use the index to select specific items from the Series 
\begin{lstlisting}
cities['Chicago']
Out[5]:
1000.0
\end{lstlisting}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Series}		
\begin{lstlisting}
cities[['Chicago', 'Portland', 'San Francisco']]
Out[6]:
Chicago          1000
Portland          900
San Francisco    1100
dtype: float64
\end{lstlisting}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Series}		
You can use \textbf{\textit{boolean indexing}} for selection.
\begin{lstlisting}
cities[cities < 1000]
Out[7]:
Austin      450
Portland    900
dtype: float64
\end{lstlisting}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]
That last one might be a little strange, so let's make it more clear - \texttt{cities < 1000} returns a Series of \texttt{True/False} values, which we then pass to our Series cities, returning the corresponding \texttt{True} items.
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]
\begin{lstlisting}
less_than_1000 = cities < 1000
print less_than_1000
print '\n'
print cities[less_than_1000]
Austin            True
Boston           False
Chicago          False
New York         False
Portland          True
San Francisco    False
dtype: bool

Austin      450
Portland    900
dtype: float64
\end{lstlisting}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]
You can also change the values in a Series on the fly.
\begin{lstlisting}
# changing based on the index
print 'Old value:', cities['Chicago']
cities['Chicago'] = 1400
print 'New value:', cities['Chicago']
Old value: 1000.0
New value: 1400.0
\end{lstlisting}
\end{frame}

\begin{lstlisting}
print cities[cities < 1000]
print '\n'

print cities[cities < 1000]
Austin      450
Portland    900
dtype: float64

Austin      750
Portland    750
dtype: float64
\end{lstlisting}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Working with Series}
What if you aren't sure whether an item is in the Series? You can check using idiomatic Python.
\begin{lstlisting}
print 'Seattle' in cities
print 'San Francisco' in cities
False
True
\end{lstlisting}
\end{frame}

Mathematical operations can be done using scalars and functions.

Boston                  NaN

You can add two Series together, which returns a union of the two Series with the addition occurring on the shared index values. Values on either Series that did not have a shared index will produce a NULL/NaN (not a number).
\begin{lstlisting}
print cities[['Chicago', 'New York', 'Portland']]
print'\n'
print cities[['Austin', 'New York']]
print'\n'
print cities[['Chicago', 'New York', 'Portland']] + cities[['Austin', 'New York']]
\end{lstlisting}
\end{frame}

Austin       NaN

\textbf{NULL Checking}
\begin{itemize}
\item Notice that because Austin, Chicago, and Portland were not found in both Series, they were returned with NULL/NaN values.
\item NULL checking can be performed with \texttt{isnull()} and \texttt{notnull()}.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]
Return a boolean series indicating which values aren't NULL
\begin{lstlisting}
cities.notnull()

Boston           False

New York          True
