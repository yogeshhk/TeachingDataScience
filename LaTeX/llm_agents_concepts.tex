\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{What Are Tools in Agentic AI?}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Tools are external capabilities the LLM can call
        \item Examples: APIs, database queries, services, internal functions
        \item Transform LLMs from passive responders to active agents
        \item Enable real-time access and action
        \item Core to execution, not just generation
      \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Why Tools Matter}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Unlock full workflow execution, not just suggestions
        \item Increase precision by avoiding hallucination
        \item Define boundaries to control risk and exposure
        \item Enable composability across systems (CRM, calendar, etc.)

\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Tools in Action: Example Workflow}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Input: ``Let John know his order is delayed and reschedule''
        \item LLM plans steps: check status, find slot, email, log
        \item Calls tools: \lstinline|get_order_status(), get_available_slots()|, etc.
        \item Generates message and triggers execution
        \item Logs events and updates systems

\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{How the Tool Loop Works}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item User gives task; LLM plans next step
        \item Parser converts text to structured tool call
        \item Tool is executed externally and returns a result
        \item LLM uses result to plan the next action
        \item Loop continues until task is complete
      \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Agent Loop: Reasoning to Action}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item LLM generates structured output (e.g., JSON or function call)
        \item System executes it and feeds back the observation
        \item LLM reflects and adjusts next step
        \item Loop of plan → act → observe → repeat
        \item Powering modern agents in LangChain, CrewAI, AutoGen, etc.
      \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{What Makes a Tool Usable}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Each tool needs: name, description, input/output schema
        \item Metadata lets the LLM reason when and how to use it
        \item Structured inputs allow reliable execution
        \item Structured outputs enable next-step reasoning
      \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Structured I/O and Parsing}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Parsers convert LLM output into executable tool calls
        \item Newer LLMs can output structured data directly
        \item JSON, function calls, or APIs simplify orchestration
        \item Structure makes loops robust and production-ready
      \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{The Bottom Line}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item LLMs alone can understand and generate text
        \item With tools, they can observe and act
        \item This turns passive models into powerful agents
        \item Tools bridge understanding and execution
      \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Sub-Agents as Tools, Not Peers}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Claude's system treats sub-agents like tools
        \item No explicit agent-to-agent handoffs
        \item Simplifies control and orchestration
    \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Agents Improve Tool Interfaces}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Claude uses a tool testing agent to refine tool descriptions
        \item Agent rewrites unclear interfaces after testing failures
        \item Result: 40\% reduction in task time for future agents
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Self Improving Agents in Practice}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Tool ergonomics improved through feedback loops
        \item Agents help reduce integration complexity
        \item Smarter interface   fewer downstream errors
    \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Synchronous Execution   Bottlenecks}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Claude's agents wait synchronously for sub agent results
        \item Simplifies coordination, but delays execution
        \item Creates sequential bottlenecks in agent chains
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{The Case for Async Architectures}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Event driven models allow async agent execution
        \item Each agent acts as events arrive-faster coordination
        \item Matches design in frameworks like LlamaIndex workflows
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Key Lessons from Claude Research}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Use multi agent design selectively and purposefully
        \item Let agents optimize tools and interfaces over time
        \item Consider async architectures to eliminate bottlenecks
    \end{itemize}
