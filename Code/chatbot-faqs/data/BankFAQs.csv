What are the advantages of investing in SIP,"A large part of the success of Mutual Funds is also the advantages they offer in terms of diversification, professional management and liquidity.

Quite simply, the incremental returns that you earn on your principal, plus accrued gains, is compounded. Rupee Cost Averaging: Most investors want to buy stocks when the prices are low and sell them when the prices are high. But timing the market is time consuming and risky.

A monthly SIP helps in averaging out the cost of purchase and benefit from the power of compounding. It also helps in creating wealth over a longer time period. The current investment scenario is still dominated by negative sentiment. This creates volatility in the markets due to confused minds of the investors.
