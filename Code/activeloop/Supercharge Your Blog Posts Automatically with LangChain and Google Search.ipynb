For young people in these routine jobs, start now by finding careers that fit your strengths and that are not easily replaced by AI. For older people, when early retirement is offered to you, consider accepting, with gig economy and volunteering to make some income and live a life you enjoy.\\n\\nWe should encourage more people to go into service careers, choosing jobs into which they can pour their hearts and souls, spreading their love and experiences.\\n\\nWe should embrace AI tools, especially for professionals, understanding that they will get better with more data and use. We should use these tools to do parts of our jobs, allowing them to do more of our routine tasks, freeing us to move into areas that are more suitable for humans.\\n\\nWe should encourage all kinds of creativity beyond the sciences: painting, architecture, music, poetry, acting, storytelling, PR, and marketing.\\n\\nLarge companies should establish and fund serious corporate social responsibility efforts and take steps to help society transition into the age of automation and the future of work.\\n\\nCorporations with a large workforce facing displacement should introduce employee training programs. These involve training employees for emotional quotient and soft skills, reimbursement for online training, and developing a culture of lifelong learning.\\n\\nService industries should develop clear career ladders for service professionals and share best practices and role models so that we attract more people to this large and more sustainable industry.\\n\\nInvestment companies should look at impact investment, not just investing in stocks or tech start-ups, but investing in companies with social impact. These companies, typically service companies, can have decent but not exponential growth and can provide lasting employment to large numbers of people. Such investments may not yield the highest returns but should be done as pro bono.\\n\\nEducational institutions should rethink their roles. Rote learning will only lead to graduates who are easily replaced by AI. Schools need to teach about emotional quotient including communication, teamwork, winning trust, and empathy. Students should be encouraged to pursue their passion, and teaching should become more personalized.\\n\\nSchools should embrace STEM education and find prodigies who will become the inventors of the next breakthroughs in AI, neurobiology, genomics, materials, energy, or basic sciences.\\n\\nWe as a society need to start shifting our culture and values. We have been conditioned to believe that our primary role in society (and even our identity) is found in wage-earning work.', metadata={'source': 'https://kaifulee.medium.com/how-to-prepare-for-ai-job-displacement-78d850e5c1ce'}),\n"," Document(page_content='“GPT-4 is a remarkable leap forward in natural language-based models, significantly expanding its potential use cases and building on the achievements of its previous iterations,” said Ferran, pointing to its expanded capability to write code in any language, he said.\\n\\nWilliams agreed, saying that AI is like any powerful tool: Organizations must do their own due diligence.\\n\\n“Are there risks that people can use it for nefarious purposes? Of course, but the benefits far outweigh the risks,” he said.', metadata={'source': 'https://venturebeat.com/security/security-risks-evolve-with-release-of-gpt-4/'}),\n"," Document(page_content='Across the globe, organizations are waking up to the power of artificial intelligence (AI). Even before ChatGPT, the technology was starting to move from being an early adopter buzzword to something capable of affecting business transformation for the corporate masses. The market for AI software, hardware and services is expected to hit yet another milestone – $500bn in value – by 2024, thanks to impressive double-digit growth. Yet however they’re deployed to drive business success, AI services are only as strong as the data that powers them.\\n\\nThat means organizations wanting to extract maximum value from AI must also build security into projects from the start to help mitigate AI security risks and threats. A best practice layered approach must begin with securing the data itself - data-centric AI security\\n\\nThe power of AI\\n\\nWe should all be aware by now of the value AI tools can provide to organizations – in both a customer-facing and back office context. One obvious advantage of chatbots like ChatGPT is in enhancing customer service with a realistic human-like interface to field queries and complaints. In doing so, it will free up staff to focus on higher-value tasks. AI-based automation could also reduce the manual, repetitive tasks some team members still have to undertake in industries like banking and retail – such as on- and offboarding customers and approving mortgages. This would also minimize human error and improve overall efficiency.\\n\\nA third output from AI tools – and perhaps the one business leaders are most excited about – revolves around decision-making. By applying the right algorithms to large datasets, companies can generate insight with which to make more successful decisions. For example, they can forecast multiple market scenarios to help predict stock levels, customer sentiment and pricing sensitivity – and adjust strategy accordingly. This will be an increasingly critical driver of agility – especially in times of tremendous business uncertainty and macro-economic volatility.\\n\\nRisk is everywhere: data security risks facing AI & machine learning applications\\n\\nYet where there is data, there are inevitably risks over how it is used and who has access to it. Top AI data security risks include:\\n\\nModel poisoning Model poisoning is a type of attack where threat actors deliberately inject malicious data into an AI or machine learning (ML) model, with the goal of compromising its performance. In most cases, the malicious data will either be significantly different from the distribution of the AI/ML’s training data or heavily biased leading the AI/ML system to misclassify the data and make unreliable decisions.\\n\\n\\n\\nData manipulation/tampering Data manipulation or tampering could occur before data is even fed into algorithms. It is a tactic used by threat actors to deceive an AI/machine learning model, sabotage results or influence other outcomes that the threat actor wants.', metadata={'source': 'https://insights.comforte.com/ai-means-business-so-start-with-data-centric-security'})]"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":11}],"source":["best_k_documents"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"0hVQWtS_gzRg","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1685384859357,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":18266,"user":{"displayName":"Ala Falaki","userId":"16596502289871441757"}},"outputId":"878e954d-a1b7-4acf-a497-13efd09b5aad"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Text to Change:  Senators Josh Hawley and Richard Blumenthal expressed their recognition of the transformative nature of AI and the need to understand its implications for elections, jobs, and security.
