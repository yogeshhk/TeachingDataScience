[Coding Interview. ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZZX9iIgFoo&amp;t=114s)

**Step 1. Refresh yourself with CS fundamentals**

- We do expect you to know a lot about algorithms and data structures and especially be able to implement them into your solutions - there is a great [bigocheatsheet](http://bigocheatsheet.com/) that may also help you!

  - [Hired in Tech](https://www.hiredintech.com/classrooms/system-design/lesson/52)

**Step 2. Coding Practice + CS review**

When you practice, do not use an IDE. You need to be able to write legible, compilable code without help with regards to layout, or spelling of standard library class/method names. I suggest solving similar style algorithmic/ DS problems on a google document or on paper to simulate a real interview. Several sites that provide similar problems to those typically asked in the interview are:

- [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/)
- [Code Jam Kickstart](https://code.google.com/codejam/kickstart/) - great practice to get a glimpse of [Google coding and algorithm questions](https://code.google.com/codejam/past-contests#kickstart). Code Jam hosts online Kickstart rounds that give participants the opportunity to test and grow their coding abilities! Participate in [one](https://code.google.com/codejam/kickstart/schedule#kickstart)—or join them all! You can also learn how to solve those problems by reading our [analysis](https://code.google.com/codejam/contest/3254486/dashboard#s=a)
- [Codeforces](http://codeforces.com/contests)
- [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)
- [Topcoder](https://community.topcoder.com/tc?module=MatchDetails&amp;rd=15712)
- [ACM-ICPC](https://icpc.baylor.edu/)
- [Code Jam](https://code.google.com/codejam/)

**Below are some tips for your Coding Rounds:**

Write very clean, well-structured code and proactively address potential errors. Exhibit advanced coding approach (e.g. may have conducted exhaustive error-checking for boundary conditions, use appropriate idiomatic constructs in code, etc.)

Test covered several corner cases, tests are simple but thorough - (dependency injection, no static cling, etc.)

Identify data structures to design a solution with optimal efficiency.

Propose multiple algorithmic approaches to single and compound problems.

Identify an optimal solution for given time-space tradeoffs.

Propose novel, creative algorithmic solutions or come up with alternative optimal solutions for different constraints.

Create a workable design for a complex problem using a sound problem solving approach (e.g., gathered requirements, identified solutions, mapped solutions to design, understand constraints and trade-offs, estimated unknowns reasonably)

Show robust comprehension of problem, identifying supplemental contingencies/challenges. Provide examples and/or alternative explanations to clarify rationale. Communicate code/algorithms/etc. in a way that left no room for confusion.

Translate ideas into code/action without the need for revision. Proactively identify and provide solutions for additional considerations beyond the initial problem, expanding the complexity/scope of solution.

- **Interview behaviors to note**

- Talk through your thought process about the questions you are asked. In all of Google&#39;s interviews, our engineers are evaluating not only your technical abilities but also how you approach problems and how you try to solve them.
- Ask clarifying questions if you do not understand the problem or need more information. Many of the questions asked in Google interviews are deliberately underspecified because our engineers are looking to see how you engage the problem. In particular, they are looking to see which areas leap to your mind as the most important piece of the technological puzzle you&#39;ve been presented.
- Think about ways to improve the solution you&#39;ll present. In many cases, the first answer that springs to mind isn&#39;t the most elegant solution and may need some refining. It&#39;s definitely worthwhile to talk about your initial thoughts to a question, but jumping immediately into presenting a brute force solution will be received less well than taking time to compose a more efficient solution.
- Access to a computer at the time of interview is required as you will be requested to write and share code. Interviewers use Google Docs to facilitate coding in real time.

- Interested in your  **thought process**  when coming up with a design solution, the recommended approach/framework should be
  - Clarifying the problems, finding the boundaries of problem space.
  - Breaking down the problem into parts, have the ability to articulate design at a high level and also be able to do a deep dive into how the component works.
  - Identify constraints and tradeoffs
  - Recovering from failure

- Typically there will be questions around  **distributing a computation over multiple machines**  (be prepared to think about this in solutions you give)
- **Avoid**  answers, which involve &quot;use a standard database and do queries against it;&quot; not looking for answers involving off-the-shelf products, rather  **how do you build from scratch**?
- Re-familiarize yourself with: concurrency, networking, abstraction, real-world performance, estimation, availability and reliability

**System Design Tips:**

System Design assesses a candidate&#39;s ability to combine knowledge, theory, experience and judgement toward solving a real-world engineering problem with significant ambiguity.

Systems Design questions are about learning from your experience and applying those lessons to future projects. We are looking for you to be able to:

- **Clarify the problem** - System Design questions are deliberately underspecified, and we expect candidates to understand where the gaps are and ask followup questions, just like in a real project, where you have to probe to find the boundaries of the problem space.
- **Break down** a complex problem into parts, and be able to discuss the overall design at both a high level and to do a deep dive into how a component in your system works.  Note you will likely have to dig deeper into the problem initially presented to clarify details and understand resource requirements and limitations.
- Identify and analyze **tradeoffs** in your design, understanding what the implications are. ** Note that we are more interested in seeing that you understand the implications of the various tradeoffs you make in your design -- we want to see a coherent design rather than evaluating if a specific tradeoff is &quot;correct&quot; or not.**
- **Recovering from failure.**   Things go wrong in real life.  At large scale they can happen more often.  How do you detect and defend against failures?
- **Avoid**  answers, which involve &quot;use a standard database and do queries against it;&quot; we&#39;re not looking for answers involving off-the-shelf products, rather how do you build from scratch?  [\*Talking about why or why not available solutions could or could not be effective does hold value]

8. Complexity of algorithms

Google interviews focus very heavily on algorithms and data structures. You&#39;ll be expected to know and apply: lists, maps, stacks, priority queues, binary trees, graphs, bags, and sets. You&#39;ll need to talk about how they&#39;re implemented and why you&#39;d choose one implementation or data structure instead of another. For algorithms you&#39;ll want to know greedy algorithms, divide and conquer, dynamic programming, recursion, and brute force search. You&#39;ll definitely want to be conversant with bigO notation, time-space complexity, and real world performance of all of this. Most importantly, you&#39;ll need to be able to pick the right data structure and algorithm for a specific problem.
 Suggestions on reading material include:Algorithm / Data Structure Theory booksGoogle Style Guides (C++, Python, Java; Android, Javascript)Besides, this is a gitHub link on Computer Science (CS) fundamentals which does a good job as a checklist on what you should master in order to prepare for coding at Google.

**Please go through:**
 - Binary search
 - BFS/DFS/Flood fill
 - Tree traversals
 - Hash tables
 - Linked list, stacks, queues, two pointers/sliding window
 - Binary heaps
 - Dynamic programming
 - Union find
 - Ad hoc/string manipulations
 - Arrays
 - Other good to know topics: Trie, segment trees/fenwick trees, bitmasks
 - Brush up on any topics that you have not touched for some time!There is a great BigO cheat sheet \&lt;[http://bigocheatsheet.com/](http://bigocheatsheet.com/)\&gt; that may also help you!
 Moving onto the practice after theory:When you practice, do not use an IDE. You need to be able to write legible, compilable code without help with regards to layout, or spelling of standard library class/method names. I suggest solving similar style algorithmic /DS problems on a google document or on paper to simulate a real interview.
 Several sites that provide similar problems to those typically asked in the interview are (medium-hard questions):HackerRank (highly encouraged)TopcoderCodeforcesGeeksforgeeks (highly encouraged)Leetcode (highly encouraged)InterviewBit (highly encouraged)KattisProblems from Cracking the Coding Interview Book
 This will help get you into the problem-solving mindset.
 Here are a couple of extra videos which are definitely worth watching before your interview:
 1) Example of a Coding Interview2) How to best prepare for a technical interview: Preparation

**Things to remember :**
 1. There will be \*no editor or compiler\* you can use on the Doc
 2. You are expected to come up with the \*most optimized production ready solution\* as possible - pseudo code etc will not be accepted.
 3. The code has to be as clean, concise and clear as possible without any visible bugs/formatting problems.
 4. Go over as many \*Data Structures &amp; Algorithms\* (basic &amp; advanced) and keep practicing questions on a Google Doc starting today.
 5. Kindly send me a weekly report on the number of questions you have solved, what are your strong points &amp; what are areas of improvement.
 6. Try solving medium questions in 15 mins &amp; hard questions in 30 mins so you have time to go over and test your code during the interview.
 7. Ask Questions &amp; Seek Clarification
 8. Think out loud - Talking through the thought process. It is similar to having a conversation with the Interviewer!
 9. Pattern Recognition
 10.Remember Big O Notation
 11.Practise Coding on TopCoder - Write clean, concise, well structured code efficiently, with good use of variables &amp; features. Always look to \*optimize\* your code!
 12.Go onto \*[pramp.com](http://pramp.com/) \&lt;[http://pramp.com/](http://pramp.com/)\&gt;\* and do a few mock interviews each week so you know how you are tracking.
 13. You can refer to  [http://interviewing.io/](http://interviewing.io/) as well - a web for anonymous mock interviews
