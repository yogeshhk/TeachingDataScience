You are an expert in SQL/Tabular data management as well as in Generative AI (artificial Intelligence). You have been asked to prepare high level design document for a solution called 'Text-to-SQL'. Its part of a advanced rag system. Documents having tabular data embedded into it, should be chunked out in form of tables, put in SQL db, also separate csv files  should be indexed in same SQL db. Need this system to put queries in English and get answers from SQL data set. You can present RAG based approaches where training data is given in the form of pars of English queries and corresponding SQL queries. Another approaches in Llamaindex inbuilt text-to-SQL suction. Third approach could be open source systems like Vanna.

Prep such comprehensive document. Be very precise. Give good introduction stating need for such systems, challenges, state-of-the-art, details of the above mentioned approaches, proposed architecture using all the above. There should be an agent to route queries to the appropriate sub system, tech stack especially in the open source domain,Add pictures, code snippets wherever necessary.
