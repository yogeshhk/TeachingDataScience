You are an expert in CAD (Computer aided Design) software development as well as Generative AI (artificial Intelligence). You have been asked to prepare high level design document for a solution called 'Text-to-CAD'. Its a co-pilot embedded in the CAD UI, where user can give 3d model generation/editing commands in plain English and those commands, internally get converted to API calls or script blocks, which are then executed in the CAD you to see the effect on screen in terms of 3D model changes.

Prep such comprehensive document. Be very precise. Give good introduction stating need for such systems, challenges, state-of-the-art, possible approaches, proposed architecture, tech stack especially in the open source domain, using free cad packages like FreeCAD python scripts. Add pictures, code snippets wherever necessary.
