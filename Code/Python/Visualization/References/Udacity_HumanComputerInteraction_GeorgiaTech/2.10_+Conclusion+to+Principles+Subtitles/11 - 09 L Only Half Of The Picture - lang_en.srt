1
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:05,940
There's one final thing you must understand about

2
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:08,370
the guidelines and heuristics and principles we've talked about.

3
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:10,320
They're only half the picture.

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,545
They're necessary for good design, but they aren't sufficient.

5
00:00:13,545 --> 00:00:15,720
You can't just grab these guidelines off the shelf,

6
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:16,740
throw them at a new task,

7
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:19,020
and expect to have a perfect interface the first time.

8
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:21,390
These principles give you a solid foundation.

9
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:22,920
But every domain, every task,

10
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:26,040
every audience has its own unique requirements and criteria.

11
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:27,925
To design usable interfaces,

12
00:00:27,925 --> 00:00:30,350
you have to understand your specific user.

13
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:32,420
Remember, that isn't you.

14
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:35,900
What that means is that you have to go out and find what your users need.

15
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:38,495
You have to get inside their head and understand the task.

16
00:00:38,495 --> 00:00:41,360
You have to prepare multiple different ideas for them to try out.

17
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:44,405
You have to evaluate those ideas with real users.

18
00:00:44,405 --> 00:00:47,360
You have to take that experience and use it to improve your design,

19
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,175
and start the process all over again.

20
00:00:49,175 --> 00:00:51,230
These guidelines and principles are useful in

21
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:53,360
making that process as efficient as possible,

22
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,295
but they aren't sufficient on their own.

23
00:00:55,295 --> 00:00:57,695
These principles are only half the picture.

24
00:00:57,695 --> 00:01:00,100
The other half are the methods.
