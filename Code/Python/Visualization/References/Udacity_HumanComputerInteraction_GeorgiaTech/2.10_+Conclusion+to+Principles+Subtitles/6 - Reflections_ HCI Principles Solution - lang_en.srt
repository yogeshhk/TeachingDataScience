1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,530
For me, I'm actually using an example
of one of these interfaces right now.

2
00:00:03,530 --> 00:00:06,410
I have a teleprompter in front of me.

3
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:09,718
I didn't always use a teleprompter, but
as soon as I tried one, I was hooked.

4
00:00:09,718 --> 00:00:13,137
And part of that is because of how
well designed the interface is.

5
00:00:13,137 --> 00:00:16,707
The very first time I used it,
it made things immediately easier,

6
00:00:16,707 --> 00:00:19,214
instead of introducing
a new learning curve.

7
00:00:19,214 --> 00:00:23,367
First, it uses very simple interactions,
quick presses that accomplish anything I

8
00:00:23,367 --> 00:00:26,560
could need during the actual
recording process.

9
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:30,500
Second, it builds on a good mental
model of the task that I'm performing.

10
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:33,860
It understands, that while recording,
the only things I need to do regularly

11
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:36,880
are pause, play, scroll back,
and scroll forward.

12
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,900
There are a lot of other
options that it has but

13
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:41,530
it keeps those out of the way during
the actual recording process,

14
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:43,190
because they're not
necessary at the time.

15
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,860
Personally though, I think the
teleprompter is great to analyze from

16
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:48,660
the prospective of
distributed cognition.

17
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:52,580
I struggle when recording
with talking too fast.

18
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:53,480
Without the teleprompter,

19
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:57,420
I have to remind myself to slow down,
while also remembering what to say.

20
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:59,040
That's a lot to keep in
memory at the same time.

21
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:02,980
The teleprompter lowers the cognitive
load involved in remembering what to

22
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:04,030
say, but

23
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:08,290
it also controls my speed because I
can't read what hasn't yet appeared.

24
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:11,170
So the teleprompter takes care
of two cognitive processes.

25
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:12,700
Remembering what I have to say, and

26
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:15,150
monitoring the speed at
which I am presenting.

27
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:17,260
So the system comprised
of the teleprompter and

28
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:19,690
me is better at recording
than I am alone.
