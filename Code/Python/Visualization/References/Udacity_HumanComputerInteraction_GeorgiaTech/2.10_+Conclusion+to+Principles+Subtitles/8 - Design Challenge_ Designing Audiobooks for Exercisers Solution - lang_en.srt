00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,140
There are a lot of designs that you
could propose, but the question here

2
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:06,686
isn't what you design, the question is,
how will you develop it?

3
00:00:06,686 --> 00:00:07,806
How will you evaluate it?

4
00:00:07,806 --> 00:00:10,295
How do you know which ideas are good and
which are bad?

5
00:00:10,295 --> 00:00:13,109
Now we've given some heuristics and
principles for doing this, but

6
00:00:13,109 --> 00:00:15,502
that doesn't automatically
get you to a good interface.

7
00:00:15,502 --> 00:00:18,035
That just kind of
establishes a baseline.

8
00:00:18,035 --> 00:00:20,965
That's just what the principles
portion of this course covers.

9
00:00:20,965 --> 00:00:23,445
To fully develop interfaces
using these principles,

10
00:00:23,445 --> 00:00:25,655
we need the methods of HCI as well.
