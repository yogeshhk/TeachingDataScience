00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,890
One way of knitting together
the different ideas of HCI

2
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:05,510
is to start very close and zoom out.

3
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:06,360
At the narrowest level,

4
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:09,470
we might view HCI as the interaction
between a person and an interface.

5
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:13,430
This is the processor model of
the role to human knit system.

6
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:16,020
This too looks almost like
an interaction between two computers,

7
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:17,760
one just happens to be a human.

8
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,930
But humans' actions are approached
almost computationally.

9
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:23,630
If you're going to take this model,
we need to understand a lot about what

10
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:26,875
the human can sense,
remember, and physically do.

11
00:00:26,875 --> 00:00:29,535
The model approaches HCI
in this manner as well.

12
00:00:29,535 --> 00:00:33,075
It distills the human's role into goals,
operators, methods and

13
00:00:33,075 --> 00:00:36,115
selection of rules,
all of which can be externalized.

14
00:00:36,115 --> 00:00:38,685
But this is a pretty narrow view of HCI.
