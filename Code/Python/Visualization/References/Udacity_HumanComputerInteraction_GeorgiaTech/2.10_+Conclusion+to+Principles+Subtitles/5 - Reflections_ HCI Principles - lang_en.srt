00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:04,470
When we started that conversations I
commented that when you do HCI right,

2
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:06,340
users won't actually know
you've done anything at all.

3
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:10,950
Good HCI disappears between the user and
the tasks that they're completing.

4
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:17,310
As a result, people can underestimate
how complex good HCI can be to leverage.

5
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:20,590
In this unit, one of my goals has
been to help pull back the curtain

6
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:23,000
on all the theories that
go on behind the scenes

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,690
of the designs of some of
the interfaces that you use everyday.

8
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:30,460
So as we close this unit, take a second
to reflect on the interfaces you use

9
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:33,710
that have disappeared between you and
the task.

10
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:36,790
Focus especially on interfaces that
were never visible in the first place,

11
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:39,960
not interfaces that became
invisible by learning.

12
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:42,830
Which of the principles that we've
discussed do you now see at play

13
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:44,790
in the design of some
of those interfaces?
