00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:04,000
Let's watch the videos of Morgan
disabling her security system again.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:04,689
This time though,

3
00:00:04,689 --> 00:00:09,140
let's try to approach this from a more
cognitive task analysis perspective.

4
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:11,970
We won't be able to do that fully,
because doing a full cognitive task

5
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:15,920
analysis means interviewing, asking
the user to think out loud, and more.

6
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:18,600
But we can at least
try out this approach.

7
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,600
Remember, in doing
a cognitive task analysis for

8
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:23,720
a task like this, your goal is to
build a model of the sequence of

9
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:26,060
thoughts going on
inside the user's head.

10
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:29,844
Pay special attention to what she needs
to remember at each step of the process.
