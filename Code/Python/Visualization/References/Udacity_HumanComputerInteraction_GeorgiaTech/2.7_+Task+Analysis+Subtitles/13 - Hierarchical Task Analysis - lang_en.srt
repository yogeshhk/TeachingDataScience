00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,790
Cognitive task analysis advocates building models of

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:06,030
human reasoning and decision-making in complex tasks.

3
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:09,150
However, a challenge presented here is that very often,

4
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:13,575
large tasks are actually composed of many multiple smaller tasks.

5
00:00:13,575 --> 00:00:16,710
We can see this plainly present in our cognitive model of driving.

6
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:19,169
These tasks are so high level,

7
00:00:19,169 --> 00:00:22,200
that it's almost useful to describe driving in these terms.

8
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:24,710
Each part can be broken down into various sub-tasks,

9
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:27,030
like iteratively checking all the cars around you,

10
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:30,570
or periodically checking how long it is until next turn needs to be made.

11
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:34,705
What's more, these smaller tasks could then be used in different contexts.

12
00:00:34,705 --> 00:00:36,240
Route monitoring, for example,

13
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:38,000
isn't only useful when driving a car,

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,750
it might be useful while running or biking or while riding as a passenger.

15
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:44,765
Traffic monitoring might be something that autonomous vehicles might do,

16
00:00:44,765 --> 00:00:46,010
not just the human user.

17
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:50,540
So, the analysis of a task in a particular context could be useful in designing

18
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:55,130
interfaces for other contexts if we break the analysis down into sub-tasks.

19
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:57,080
So, let's take a simple example of this.

20
00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:00,860
Here is a somewhat simple model of the act of buying something online.

21
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:03,290
Notice that a lot of the tasks involved here are

22
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:05,840
general to anyone shopping on any website and yet,

23
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,675
every website needs to provide all of these functions.

24
00:01:08,675 --> 00:01:12,785
As a side note, notice also the interesting analogy going on with the top two.

25
00:01:12,785 --> 00:01:15,320
Online, there is no cart or checkout station,

26
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:17,810
but we borrowed those to help the user understand

27
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:21,110
the shopping process online and how similar it is to shopping in a store.

28
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:25,655
Now, anyway, if we treat this cognitive task analysis more hierarchically,

29
00:01:25,655 --> 00:01:29,830
we can start to see a well-defined sub-task around this checkout process.

30
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:34,490
Every online vendor I've ever encountered has these steps in its checkout process.

31
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:36,890
Now, because this is so well-defined,

32
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:38,690
we can actually leverage existing tools,

33
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:41,630
like existing payment widgets or something like PayPal.

34
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:44,854
This hierarchical task analysis helps us understand

35
00:01:44,854 --> 00:01:48,350
what tools might already be available to accomplish certain portions of our task,

36
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:50,570
or how we might design certain things to

37
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:53,825
transfer between different tasks and different contexts.

38
00:01:53,825 --> 00:01:58,280
Hierarchical task analysis also lets the designers of the site abstract over

39
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:02,855
this part of the process and focus more on what might make their particular site unique.

40
00:02:02,855 --> 00:02:06,770
This kind of task analysis is so common that you generally will find tasks and

41
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:10,530
sub-tasks whenever you're looking at the results of a cognitive task analysis.

42
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:13,855
So, it's important to remember the strengths supplied by this hierarchy,

43
00:02:13,855 --> 00:02:17,375
abstracting out unnecessary details for a certain level of abstraction,

44
00:02:17,375 --> 00:02:19,580
modularizing designs or principles,

45
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:22,895
so they can be transferred between different tasks or different contexts,

46
00:02:22,895 --> 00:02:25,280
and organizing the cognitive task analysis in

47
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,985
a way that makes it easier to understand and reason over.

48
00:02:27,985 --> 00:02:29,810
Last, it's really important to note that

49
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:32,090
the cognitive and hierarchical task analyses that

50
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:34,670
we've shown here are extremely simplistic,

51
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:37,550
mostly, honestly because of the limited screen real estate.

52
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:40,100
When you're creating a real cognitive models,

53
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:42,300
you'll likely have several levels of abstraction,

54
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:43,940
several different states, and

55
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:46,850
additional annotating information like what the user has to keep in mind,

56
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:49,895
or how they might be feeling at a certain stage in the analysis.

57
00:02:49,895 --> 00:02:53,480
We'll put some examples of some good thorough models in the notes.
