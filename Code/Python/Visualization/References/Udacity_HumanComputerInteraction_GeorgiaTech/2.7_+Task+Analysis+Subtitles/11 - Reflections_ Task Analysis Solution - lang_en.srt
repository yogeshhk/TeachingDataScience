00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:03,380
You can probably guess my bias on
this issue, given that I've already

2
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:07,200
badmouthed the processor model and
I also teach cognitive systems.

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,100
So I'm generally going to prefer
methods that focus on cognition.

4
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:13,380
I think it's important to note here
though that both approaches have

5
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:15,030
significant value.

6
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:17,610
The GOMS model and
its emphasis on identifying goals and

7
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:20,170
operators is actually
very useful in HCI.

8
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:24,310
Because it forces us to very clearly and
deliberately identify user goals and

9
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:26,670
the sequence of actions
that accomplish them.

10
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:29,710
We can get so caught up in user
experiences that we forget the user

11
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:33,390
experience is born out
of individual operators.

12
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:36,680
So while I wouldn't advocate focusing
solely on the user as some kind of input

13
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:40,900
output information processor, there's
value in defining the user's operation

14
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:43,640
as clearly and
specifically as we define a computer's.
