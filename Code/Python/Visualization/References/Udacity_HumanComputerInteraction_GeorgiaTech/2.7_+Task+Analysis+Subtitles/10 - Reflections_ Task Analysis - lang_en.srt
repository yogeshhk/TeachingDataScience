1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:02,630
This conflict between more
processor-oriented and

2
00:00:02,630 --> 00:00:05,300
more predictor-oriented models
of the user actually gets at

3
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:09,220
the core of an old battle in psychology
between behaviorism and cognitivism.

4
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:13,370
Behaviorism emphasized things
that could be observed.

5
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:15,250
We can see what input
a person is receiving.

6
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:17,240
We can see the output they're producing.

7
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:20,630
And that might be all we need to
understand the design of things.

8
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:23,320
Cognitivism, on the other hand,
suggests we can and

9
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:26,070
should get into the mind of what
people are actually thinking and

10
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:29,920
how systems like memory and
learning and perception actually work.

11
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:32,970
So take a moment and
reflect on what you think about this.

12
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:34,111
When designing interfaces,

13
00:00:34,111 --> 00:00:37,360
how much attention should you devote to
observable goals, operators and methods?

14
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,063
And how much do you devote to
understanding internal thought

15
00:00:40,063 --> 00:00:42,560
processes, like cognition,
learning, and memory?
