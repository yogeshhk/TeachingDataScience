1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,780
GOMS and cognitive tasks analysis
are just two of the many alternatives to

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:06,190
understanding how users approach tasks.

3
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:08,410
More in line with the human
information processor models,

4
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:11,940
there exist models like KLM,
TLM, and MHP,

5
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:15,750
which capture even finer grain actions
for estimating performance speed.

6
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:18,870
There are other extensions to GOMS as
well that add things like sub goals, or

7
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:22,940
other ways of expressing content
like CPM-GOMS and NGOMSL.

8
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:26,930
CPM-GOMS focuses on parallel tasks,
while NGOMSL

9
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:31,360
provides a natural language interface
for interacting with GOMS models.

10
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:33,647
More on the lines of cognitive models,

11
00:00:33,647 --> 00:00:36,973
there exists other methods
as well like CDM, TKS, CFM,

12
00:00:36,973 --> 00:00:42,260
Applied Cognitive Task Analyses, and
Skill-Based Cognitive Task Analyses.

13
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:45,830
CDM puts a focus on places
where critical decisions occur.

14
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:49,380
TKS focuses on the nature
of humans' knowledge.

15
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:51,566
CFM focuses on complexity.

16
00:00:51,566 --> 00:00:54,780
ACTA and Skill-Based CTA are two ways of

17
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:58,420
gathering the information necessary
to create a cognitive model.

18
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:01,612
There also exists other frameworks
more common in other disciplines, for

19
00:01:01,612 --> 00:01:04,819
example, production systems are common
to an artificial intelligence.

20
00:01:04,819 --> 00:01:07,910
But they're intended to model cognitive
systems the same way these cognitive

21
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:08,910
models do.

22
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:10,960
So we can apply production
systems here as well and

23
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,400
attempt to prescribe rules for
users to follow.
