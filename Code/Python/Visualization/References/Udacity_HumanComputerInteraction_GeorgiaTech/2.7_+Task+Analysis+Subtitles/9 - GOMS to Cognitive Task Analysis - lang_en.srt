Gomes models are human
information processor models.

2
00:00:03,530 --> 00:00:06,600
This method largely assumes the human
is an input output machine,

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:10,180
and it doesn't get too much into
the internal reasoning of the human.

4
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:12,740
Instead, it distills their reasoning
into things that can be described

5
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:15,290
explicitly like goals and methods.

6
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:17,146
Some would argue, myself included,

7
00:00:17,146 --> 00:00:21,560
that human reasoning is actually too
nuanced and complex to be so simplified.

8
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:23,130
They, or we,

9
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:27,110
advocate other models to get more into
what goes on inside the user's head.

10
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:29,730
That's where cognitive
task analysis comes in.

11
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:33,640
Cognitive task analysis is another way
of examining tasks, but it puts a much

12
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:37,430
higher emphasis on things like memory,
attention, and cognitive load.

13
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:40,880
Thus, cognitive task analysis adopts
more of the predictor view of

14
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:42,131
the human's role in the system.
