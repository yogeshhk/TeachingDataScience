1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,793
Just like Goms models, cognitive task
analysis also have some strength and

2
00:00:03,793 --> 00:00:05,120
some weaknesses.

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:08,140
One strength is that they
emphasize mental processes.

4
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:09,220
Unlike the Goms model,

5
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:13,520
cognitive task analysis puts an emphasis
on what goes on inside the users head.

6
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:17,480
It's thus much better equipped to
understand how experts think and work.

7
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:20,420
The information it generated is
also formal enough to be used for

8
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:23,820
interface design, for comparison
in mode alternatives and more.

9
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:25,630
There are disadvantages though.

10
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:29,480
One, cogni-task analysis are incredibly
time-consuming to perform.

11
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:31,260
They involve talking to
multiple experts for

12
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:35,020
extended period of time,
then systematically analyzing the data.

13
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:40,030
A second weakness is that cogni-task
analysis risk deemphasizing context.

14
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:42,846
In zooming in on the individual's
own thought processes,

15
00:00:42,846 --> 00:00:47,500
cogni-task analysis risks deemphasizing
details that are out in the world.

16
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,392
Like the role of
physical capabilities or

17
00:00:49,392 --> 00:00:52,534
interactions amongst different people,
or different artifacts.

18
00:00:52,534 --> 00:00:53,244
And third,

19
00:00:53,244 --> 00:00:57,934
like Goms models, cogni-task analysis
also isn't well suited to novices.

20
00:00:57,934 --> 00:01:00,949
It's well suited to expert users who
have very strong models of the way

21
00:01:00,949 --> 00:01:04,340
they work and clearly understand
their own mental thought processes.

22
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:05,730
But they're not very well suited for

23
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:08,480
novice users who are still trying
to learn how to use an interface.
