1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,600
Agile development techniques don't replace the design life cycle,

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,010
they just caffeinate it.

3
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:08,400
We're still doing need-finding but we're probably just doing it a little bit more

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,910
tacitly by reading user feedback or checking out interaction logs.

5
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:13,890
We're still brainstorming design alternatives,

6
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:15,810
but we're really just coming up with them in our head

7
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:18,180
because we then immediately move them on to prototyping.

8
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:20,020
Our prototypes are still just prototypes.

9
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:21,420
They just happen to work.

10
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:24,270
We're still doing evaluation by rolling our changes out to

11
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:27,330
only certain participants first to make sure the respons is good.

12
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:31,065
The results of that evaluation then feed the same process over and over again.

13
00:00:31,065 --> 00:00:35,585
So, taking an agile approach to the design lifecycle really doesn't change cycle itself,

14
00:00:35,585 --> 00:00:38,030
it just changes the rate at which we go through it and

15
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:41,500
the types of prototypes and the types of evaluation that we actually do.

16
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:44,090
Remember also, the Chamberlain sharpen maiden

17
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:46,885
advocated still doing the initial need-finding step.

18
00:00:46,885 --> 00:00:49,490
Rarely, will we go from no interface at all to

19
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:51,560
a working prototype quite as quickly as we go

20
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:53,810
through revisions of those working prototypes.

21
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:57,440
So, it's useful to do an initial need-finding phase the way we normally would do it.

22
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,065
Then, proceeding to a more agile revision process

23
00:01:00,065 --> 00:01:03,270
once we have a working prototype to actually tweak and modify.
