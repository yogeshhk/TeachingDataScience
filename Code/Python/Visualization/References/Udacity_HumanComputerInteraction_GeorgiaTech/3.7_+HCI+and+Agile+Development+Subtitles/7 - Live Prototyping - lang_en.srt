00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:04,250
One application of Agile development
in HCI is the kind of new idea of

2
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:05,640
live prototyping.

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:08,210
Live prototyping is a bit of
an oxymoron, and the fact

4
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:12,420
that it's an oxymoron speaks to how
far along prototyping tools have come.

5
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:15,960
We've gotten to the point in some areas
of development where constructing actual

6
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:19,670
working interfaces is just as
easy as constructing prototypes.

7
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:21,560
So here's one example of this,

8
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:24,320
it's a tool we use at
Udacity called Optimizely.

9
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,210
It allows for drag and
drop creation of real working webpages.

10
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:31,800
The interface is very similar to many of
the wire-frame tools out there, and yet

11
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,060
this website is actually live.

12
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:36,910
I can just click a button and
this site goes public.

13
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:40,335
Why bother constructing prototypes
before constructing my final interface,

14
00:00:40,335 --> 00:00:44,400
when constructing the final interface
is as easy as constructing prototypes?

15
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:48,120
Of course, this only addresses one of
the reasons we construct prototypes.

16
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:50,850
We don't just construct them because
they're usually easier, we also

17
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:54,150
construct them to get feedback before
we roll out a bad design to everyone.

18
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:57,620
But when we get to the point of making
small little tweaks or small revisions,

19
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:00,900
or if we have a lot of experience with
designing interfaces in the first place,

20
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:02,965
this might not be a bad place to start.

21
00:01:02,965 --> 00:01:06,174
It's especially true if the cost
of failure is relatively low, and

22
00:01:06,174 --> 00:01:08,944
if the possible benefit of
success is particularly high.

23
00:01:08,944 --> 00:01:12,470
I would argue that's definitely the case
for any kind of e-commerce site.

24
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:15,240
The cost of failure is maybe
losing a few sales but

25
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:19,370
the possible benefit is gaining more
sales for a much longer time period.

26
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:22,190
I'm sure anyone would risk having
fewer sales on one day for

27
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:25,360
the possible reward of having
more sales every subsequent day.
