00:00:02,810 --> 00:00:07,830
Here are five quick tips for using HCI and Agile development together,

2
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:09,570
especially for mitigating the risks to

3
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:13,455
the user experience presented by this more Agile development process.

4
00:00:13,455 --> 00:00:16,605
Number one, start more traditional.

5
00:00:16,605 --> 00:00:20,040
Start with a more traditional need-finding and prototyping process

6
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:23,955
and shift to more Agile development once you have something up and running.

7
00:00:23,955 --> 00:00:28,695
Jacob Nielsen describes this as doing some foundational user-research.

8
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:30,330
Once you have something up and running,

9
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:33,510
you have a way of probing the user experience further,

10
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:35,060
but you need something solid to begin with,

11
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:37,634
and that comes from the more traditional process.

12
00:00:37,634 --> 00:00:41,050
Number two, focus on small changes.

13
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:44,180
Notice that when I was doing live prototyping in AB testing,

14
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:47,270
I was making a small change to an existing interface,

15
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:50,240
not building an entire new site from scratch.

16
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:54,245
Number three, adopt a parallel track method.

17
00:00:54,245 --> 00:00:58,355
Agile development often uses short two-week sprints and development.

18
00:00:58,355 --> 00:01:03,035
Under that setup, have the HCI research one sprint ahead of the implementation.

19
00:01:03,035 --> 00:01:05,450
The HCI team can do two weeks sprints of

20
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:08,665
need-finding prototyping and low-fidelity evaluation.

21
00:01:08,665 --> 00:01:12,740
Then, hand the results to the development team for their next sprint.

22
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:16,805
Number four, be careful with consistency.

23
00:01:16,805 --> 00:01:19,730
One of our design principles was consistency both

24
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:22,580
within our interfaces and across interface design as a whole.

25
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:26,240
If your interface caters to frequent visitors or users,

26
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:30,200
you'll want to be conservative in how often you mess with their expectations.

27
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:33,155
If you're designing for something like a museum kiosk though,

28
00:01:33,155 --> 00:01:35,930
you can be more liberal in your frequent changes.

29
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:40,880
Number five, nest your design cycles in Agile development,

30
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,610
you go through many small design cycles rapidly,

31
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:46,505
and each cycle gives you a tiny bit of new information.

32
00:01:46,505 --> 00:01:48,949
Take all that new information you gather,

33
00:01:48,949 --> 00:01:50,300
and use it in the context of

34
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:55,139
a broader more traditional design cycle aimed at long-term substantive improvements,

35
00:01:55,139 --> 00:01:57,530
instead of small optimizations.
