1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,520
Video games are one of
the purest examples of HCI.

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:05,890
They're actually a great place
to study HCI, because so

3
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:08,760
many of the topics we discuss are so
salient.

4
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:11,800
For example, we discussed the need for
logical mapping between actions and

5
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:12,870
effects.

6
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:14,590
A good game exemplifies that.

7
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:17,380
The actions that the user takes with
the controller should feel like they're

8
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:19,510
actually interacting
within the game world.

9
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:21,720
We discussed the power
of feedback cycles.

10
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:25,400
Video games are near constant feedback
cycles as the user performs actions,

11
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,960
evaluates the results and
adjust accordingly.

12
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,740
In fact, if you read through video
game reviews you'll find that

13
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:34,560
many of the criticisms are actually
criticisms of bad HCI.

14
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:37,410
The controls are tough to use,
it's hard to figure out what happened.

15
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:40,280
The penalty for
failure is too low or too high.

16
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:43,170
All of these are examples
of poor interface design.

17
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:45,690
In gaming though there's such a tight
connection between the task and

18
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:46,710
the interface.

19
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:49,750
Their frustrations with a task
can help us quickly identify

20
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:50,640
problems with the interface.
