00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:03,890
Classes on network security are often
most concerned with the algorithms and

2
00:00:03,890 --> 00:00:06,450
encryption methods that must be
safeguarded to ensure secure

3
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:07,800
communications.

4
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:10,730
But the most secure communication
strategies in the world are weakened if

5
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:12,770
people just refuse to use them.

6
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:15,080
And historically, we've found people
have very little patience for

7
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:18,980
instances where security measures get
in the way of them doing their tasks.

8
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:21,640
For security to be useful
it has to be usable.

9
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:24,730
If it isn't usable,
people just won't use it.

10
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:27,970
XEI can increase the usability
of security in a number of ways.

11
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:31,160
For one, it can make those
actions simply easier to perform.

12
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:34,230
CAPTCHAs are forms that are meant
to ensure users are humans.

13
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:36,810
And they used to involve recognizing
letters in complex images, but

14
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:39,290
now they're often as
simple as a check-box.

15
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:41,960
The computer recognizes
human-like mouse movements and

16
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:44,890
uses that to evaluate
whether the user is a human.

17
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:47,822
That makes it much less frustrating to
participate in that security activity.

18
00:00:47,822 --> 00:00:51,043
But HCI can also make security
more usable by visualizing and

19
00:00:51,043 --> 00:00:53,170
communicating the need.

20
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:55,710
Many people get frustrated when systems
require passwords that meet certain

21
00:00:55,710 --> 00:01:00,050
standards or complexity, but
that's because it seems arbitrary.

22
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:02,740
If the system instead expresses
to the user the rationale behind

23
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:06,120
the requirement, the requirement
can be much less frustrating.

24
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:09,370
I've even seen a password form that
treats password selection like a game

25
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:10,640
where you're ranked against others for

26
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,960
how difficult your password
would be to guess.

27
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,620
That's a way to incentivize
strong password selection

28
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:17,270
making security more usable.
