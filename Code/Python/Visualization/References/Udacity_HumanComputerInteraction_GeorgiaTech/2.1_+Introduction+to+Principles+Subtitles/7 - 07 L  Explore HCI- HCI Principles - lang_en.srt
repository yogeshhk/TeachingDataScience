1
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:06,780
Throughout this unit, I repeatedly ask you to revisit the area

2
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:09,735
of HCI you chose to keep in mind throughout our conversations.

3
00:00:09,735 --> 00:00:10,860
Now, take a second,

4
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:12,585
and try to pull all those things together.

5
00:00:12,585 --> 00:00:14,640
You've thought about how your chosen area applies

6
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:16,605
to each of the models of the humans role.

7
00:00:16,605 --> 00:00:18,810
How it applies to various different design guidelines,

8
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:22,125
and how it interacts with society and culture as a whole.

9
00:00:22,125 --> 00:00:24,330
How does moving through those different levels

10
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:26,460
changed the kinds of designs you have in mind.

11
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:29,775
Are you building up from low-level interactions to high-level effects?

12
00:00:29,775 --> 00:00:31,950
Are you starting at the top with the desired outcome and

13
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:34,470
working your way down to the individual operations?

14
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:36,360
There are no right or wrong answers here.

15
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:40,090
The important thing is reflecting on your own reasoning process.
