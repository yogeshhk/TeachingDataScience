1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:04,240
As a processor, we might simply look
at what information is communicated to

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:06,570
Morgan, when, and how.

3
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:09,230
As a predictor, we might look
instead at how the interface

4
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:12,800
meshes with Morgan's needs with regard
to this task, how easy it is to access,

5
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,640
how easy the commands are to perform,
and so on.

6
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:19,030
As a participant, we might look at
the broader interactions between this

7
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:22,220
interface and Morgan's other tasks and
social activities.

8
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:26,260
You might look at how increased access
to books changes her life in other ways.

9
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:29,700
But really, this challenge is
too big to address this quickly.

10
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:32,930
So instead, let's return to this
challenge throughout our conversations,

11
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:37,030
and use it as a running dialogue to
explore HCI principles and methods.
