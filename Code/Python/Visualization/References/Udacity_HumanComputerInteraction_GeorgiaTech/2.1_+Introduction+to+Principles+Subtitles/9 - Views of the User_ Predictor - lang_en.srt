1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:04,160
A second way of viewing the human
is to view them as a predictor.

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:07,730
Here, we care deeply about the human's
knowledge, experience, expectations, and

3
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:08,950
their thought process.

4
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:10,690
That's why we call them the predictor.

5
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:13,390
We want them to be able to predict
what will happen in the world

6
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:15,970
as a result of some action they take.

7
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:18,890
So we want them to be able
to map input to output.

8
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:20,440
And that means getting
inside their head.

9
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:22,320
Understanding what they're thinking,
what they're seeing,

10
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,250
what they're feeling when they're
interacting with some task.

11
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:26,470
If we're taking this perspective,

12
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:28,700
then the interface must
fit with what humans know.

13
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:30,810
It must fit with their knowledge.

14
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:33,610
It must help the user learn what
they don't already know and

15
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:35,690
efficiently leverage what
they do already know.

16
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:37,650
And toward that end,

17
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:41,400
we evaluate these kind of interfaces
with qualitative studies.

18
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,570
These are often ex situ studies.

19
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:47,300
We might perform task analyses to see
where users are spending their time.

20
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:49,840
Or perform cognitive walk-throughs
to understand the user's thought

21
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,010
process throughout some task.

22
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:55,470
We can see pretty clearly that this view
gives us some advantages over viewing

23
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:59,740
the user simply as a sensory processor,
just as another computer in the system.

24
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:04,030
However, here we're still focusing
on one user and one task.

25
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:05,720
And sometimes that's useful.

26
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:08,880
But many times we want to look
even more broadly than that.

27
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,750
That's when we take
the third participant peel.
