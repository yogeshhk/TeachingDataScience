00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:03,770
In looking at human-computer
interaction, it's important that we

2
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:07,480
understand the role that we expect the
human to play in this overall system.

3
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:11,865
Let's talk about three different
possible types of roles the human can

4
00:00:11,865 --> 00:00:15,090
play, processor, predictor,
and participant.

5
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:19,810
First, we might think of the human
as being nothing more than a sensory

6
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:20,790
processor.

7
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:23,530
They take input in and
they spit output out.

8
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:25,300
They're kind of like another
computer in the system,

9
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:26,959
just one that we can't
see the inside of.

10
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:31,490
If we are designing with this role in
mind then our main concern is that

11
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:34,170
the interface fit within
known human limits.

12
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:36,550
These are things like
what humans can sense,

13
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:40,840
what they can store in memory, and what
they can physically do in the world.

14
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:45,730
In this case, usability means that
the interface is physically usable.

15
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:49,210
User can see all the colors,
touch all the buttons, and so on.

16
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:50,280
With this model,

17
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:54,070
we evaluate our interfaces
with quantitative experiments.

18
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:57,470
That means we take numeric measurements
on how quickly the user can complete

19
00:00:57,470 --> 00:01:01,410
some task or how quickly they might
react to some incoming stimulus.

20
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:04,670
Now, as you might have guessed,
the processor view is not the one we'll

21
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:07,240
generally take when we
talk about good design.

22
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:10,460
Instead, we'll probably divide our time
pretty equally between the other two

23
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:11,250
perspectives.
