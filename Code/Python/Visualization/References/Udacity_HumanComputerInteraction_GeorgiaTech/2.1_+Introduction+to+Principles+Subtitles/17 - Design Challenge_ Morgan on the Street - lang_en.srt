1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:02,300
So keeping in mind everything
we've talked about,

2
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:04,400
let's design something for Morgan.

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:07,090
Morgan walks to work,
she likes to listen to audiobooks,

4
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:08,530
mostly non fiction.

5
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:11,540
But she doesn't just want to listen,
she wants to be able to take notes and

6
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:12,150
leave bookmarks.

7
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:14,380
And do everything else you
do when you're reading.

8
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:17,070
What would designing for her look like,
from the perspectives of viewing her as

9
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:20,450
a processor, a predictor,
and a participant?

10
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:23,660
How much this different designs affect
user experience as an individual in

11
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:25,230
her local group of friends.

12
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:27,400
And the society as a whole
if the design caught on.
