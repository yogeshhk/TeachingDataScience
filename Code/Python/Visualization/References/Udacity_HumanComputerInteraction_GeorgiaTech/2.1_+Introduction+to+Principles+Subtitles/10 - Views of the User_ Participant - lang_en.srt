1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:04,360
A third view on the user is to look
at the user as a participant in some

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:05,700
environment.

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:08,930
That means we're not just interested
in what's going on inside their head.

4
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:11,830
We're also interested in what's going
on around them at the same time,

5
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:14,400
like what other tasks or
interfaces they're using, or

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,750
what other people they're
interacting with.

7
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:20,300
We want to understand for example,
what's competing for their attention?

8
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:22,800
What are their available
cognitive resources?

9
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,170
What's the importance of the task
relative to everything else that's

10
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:26,600
going on?

11
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:30,240
So if we take this view, then our
interface must fit with the context.

12
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:34,920
It's not enough that the user is able
to physically use the system and

13
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:36,790
knows how to use the system.

14
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:39,880
They must be able to actually interact
with the system in the context

15
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:40,420
where they need it.

16
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:42,700
And because context is so

17
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:46,310
important here,
we evaluate it with in situ studies.

18
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:49,340
We can't simply look at the user and
the interface in a vacuum.

19
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:52,320
We have to actually view and
evaluate them in the real world

20
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,720
using the interface in whatever
context is most relevant.

21
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:58,700
If we're evaluating a new GPS
application, for example,

22
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:00,040
we need to actually go out and

23
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:04,140
look at it in the context of real
drivers driving on real roads.

24
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:07,070
The information we get from them
using the app in our lab setting

25
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:10,170
isn't as useful as understanding how
they're going to actually use it

26
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:11,050
out in the real world.

27
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:14,920
These are in situ studies,
which are studies of the interface and

28
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:18,320
the user within the real
complete context of the task.
