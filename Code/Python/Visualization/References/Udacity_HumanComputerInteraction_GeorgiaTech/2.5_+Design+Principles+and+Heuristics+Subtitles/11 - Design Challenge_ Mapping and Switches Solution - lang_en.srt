00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:02,418
There are a few things
we could do actually.

2
00:00:02,418 --> 00:00:05,040
Maybe we could put a small letter next
to each light switch that indicates

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,280
which light in the room
that switch controls.

4
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:10,310
K for kitchen, C for counter top,
B for breakfast room.

5
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:13,250
Maybe we actually put icons
that demonstrates which

6
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:14,770
kind of light is
controlled by each switch.

7
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:17,150
So the counter top lights
are kind of sconce lights, so

8
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:20,550
maybe we put an icon that looks
like the counter top lights.

9
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:23,950
But likely the easiest thing is actually
the way the system really was designed.

10
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:26,989
I just didn't notice it until
I started writing this video.

11
00:00:26,989 --> 00:00:30,222
The lights from left to right in
the room are actually controlled by

12
00:00:30,222 --> 00:00:32,659
the light switches from
left to right on the wall.

13
00:00:32,659 --> 00:00:35,304
This switch controls
the light over there.

14
00:00:35,304 --> 00:00:38,023
This switch controls
the light right here.

15
00:00:38,023 --> 00:00:40,900
And this switch controls
the light back there.

16
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:42,960
That actually forms
a pretty intuitive mapping.
