00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,500
The structure principle is concerned with the overall architecture of a user interface.

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,510
In many ways, it's more closely related to

3
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:10,410
the narrower field of user interface design than HCI more generally.

4
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:12,510
It comes from Constantine and Lockwood,

5
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:15,100
and they define it as their structure principle, which says that,

6
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:17,715
"Design should organize a user-interface purposefully,

7
00:00:17,715 --> 00:00:19,830
in meaningful and useful ways,

8
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:24,405
based on clear, consistent models that are apparent and recognizable to users,

9
00:00:24,405 --> 00:00:28,030
putting related things together and separating unrelated things,

10
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:32,165
differentiating dissimilar things and making similar things resemble one another."

11
00:00:32,165 --> 00:00:33,530
It's a long sentence,

12
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:36,950
but what it really says is we should organize our user interfaces in

13
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:41,885
ways that helps the user's mental model match the actual content of the task.

14
00:00:41,885 --> 00:00:45,290
What's interesting to me about the structure principle is that it

15
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:49,625
borrows from a form of UI design that predates computers entirely.

16
00:00:49,625 --> 00:00:52,940
We find many of the principles we learned in designing newspapers and

17
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:56,275
textbooks apply nicely to user interfaces as well.

18
00:00:56,275 --> 00:01:00,515
For example, this is the Wall Street Journal print edition from several years ago,

19
00:01:00,515 --> 00:01:02,900
and here's the Wall Street Journal website.

20
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:05,600
Notice that many of the structural principles present in

21
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,090
the print version are present in the website as well.

22
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:11,050
Now, part of that is for brand consistency,

23
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:14,480
but part of it is because the very same ideas we used in developing

24
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:18,530
magazines and newspapers still apply to the development of websites.

25
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:22,000
Lines and spacing still separate different categories of articles,

26
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,360
headlines are still in bold,

27
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,115
while the article text is smaller.

28
00:01:25,115 --> 00:01:28,460
Now, there are, of course, differences because the website can, for example,

29
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:30,710
link to articles while physical papers cannot,

30
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:33,950
which is why these are all shorter than the articles in the actual paper are.

31
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:36,320
But we see a lot of the same principles at work in

32
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,050
the website that were at work in the physical layout.

33
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:41,270
Those are largely parts of structure.

34
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:45,185
Organizing things in intuitive ways that group together similar parts,

35
00:01:45,185 --> 00:01:50,130
separate dissimilar parts, and help the user navigate what they're consuming.
