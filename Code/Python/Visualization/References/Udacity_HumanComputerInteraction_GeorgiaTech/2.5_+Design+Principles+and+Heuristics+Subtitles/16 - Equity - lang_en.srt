1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,220
The principle of flexibility
in some ways appears to

2
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:05,120
clash with the principle of equity.

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:08,119
But both come from the principles
of universal design.

4
00:00:08,119 --> 00:00:11,683
The principle of flexibility said the
design should accommodate a wide range

5
00:00:11,683 --> 00:00:13,721
of individual preferences and abilities.

6
00:00:13,721 --> 00:00:16,436
But the principle of equity
says the design is useful and

7
00:00:16,436 --> 00:00:18,922
marketable to people with
diverse abilities, and

8
00:00:18,922 --> 00:00:21,981
it goes on to say we should provide
the same means for all users,

9
00:00:21,981 --> 00:00:25,550
identical whenever possible and
equivalent when not.

10
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:29,406
And we should avoid segregating or
stigmatizing any users.

11
00:00:29,406 --> 00:00:31,999
Now, in some ways,
these systems might compete.

12
00:00:31,999 --> 00:00:34,840
This says we should allow every user
to use the system the same way,

13
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:37,174
whereas this one says that
we should allow different,

14
00:00:37,174 --> 00:00:40,360
flexible methods of
interacting with the system.

15
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:43,150
In reality, though, these are actually
complementary of one another.

16
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:48,350
Equity is largely about helping all
users have the same user experience,

17
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:51,210
while flexibility might be
a means to achieve that.

18
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:54,900
For example, if we want all our
users to enjoy using our interface,

19
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:59,400
keeping things discoverable for novice
users and efficient for expert users

20
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:03,790
allows us to accommodate a wide range of
individual preferences and abilities.

21
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:07,460
User experience in this instance means
treating every user like they're within

22
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:11,160
the target audience and extending
the same benefits to all users,

23
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:13,920
including things like privacy and
security.

24
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,933
We might do that in different ways, but

25
00:01:15,933 --> 00:01:19,597
the important note is that the
experience is the same across all users.

26
00:01:19,597 --> 00:01:20,680
That's what equity is about.

27
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:26,810
One good example of equity in action are
the requirements for password resets.

28
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:29,356
We want to design a system so
that both expert and

29
00:01:29,356 --> 00:01:32,233
novice users experience
the same level of security.

30
00:01:32,233 --> 00:01:34,688
Security is part of the user experience.

31
00:01:34,688 --> 00:01:36,391
Now, experts, we would assume,

32
00:01:36,391 --> 00:01:39,440
understand the value
of a complex password.

33
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,930
Novices might not.

34
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:43,370
So if we don't have
requirements around passwords,

35
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:47,280
novices might not experience the same
level of security as experts.

36
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,190
So password requirements can be seen
as a way of making sure the user

37
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:54,880
experience across novices and experts
is the same with regard to security.

38
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,997
In the process, we might actually
frustrate novice users a little bit.

39
00:01:57,997 --> 00:02:01,437
You could actually see this as a
violation of the flexibility principle,

40
00:02:01,437 --> 00:02:05,156
that we're not flexibly accommodating
in the kind of interaction that novices

41
00:02:05,156 --> 00:02:05,833
want to have.

42
00:02:05,833 --> 00:02:08,939
But the important thing, is we're
extending the same security benefits to

43
00:02:08,939 --> 00:02:11,300
everyone, and
that's equitable treatment.

44
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:14,050
And that's also a good
example of how at times,

45
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:16,920
the different design principles
will appear to compete, and

46
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:19,420
you have to decide what the best
approach is going forward.
