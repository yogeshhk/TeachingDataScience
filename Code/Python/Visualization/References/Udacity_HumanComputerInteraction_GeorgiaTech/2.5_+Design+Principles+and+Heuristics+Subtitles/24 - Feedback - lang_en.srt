1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:04,070
Second, the system should give plenty of
feedback so that the user can understand

2
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:06,939
why the error happened and
how to avoid it in the future.

3
00:00:06,939 --> 00:00:10,403
Norman writes that feedback must be
immediate and it must be informative.

4
00:00:10,403 --> 00:00:13,110
Poor feedback can be worse
than no feedback at all.

5
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:17,566
Because it's distracting, uninformative,
and, in many cases, irritating and

6
00:00:17,566 --> 00:00:18,855
anxiety-provoking.

7
00:00:18,855 --> 00:00:22,205
If anything has ever described the
classic Windows Blue Screen of Death,

8
00:00:22,205 --> 00:00:23,015
it's this.

9
00:00:23,015 --> 00:00:23,935
It's terrifying.

10
00:00:23,935 --> 00:00:24,505
It's bold.

11
00:00:24,505 --> 00:00:25,595
It's cryptic.

12
00:00:25,595 --> 00:00:28,155
And it scares you more
than it informs you.

13
00:00:28,155 --> 00:00:31,387
Nielsen writes that error messages
should be expressed in plain language

14
00:00:31,387 --> 00:00:34,005
(no codes),
precisely indicate the problem, and

15
00:00:34,005 --> 00:00:36,280
constructively suggest a solution.

16
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:39,010
Note this tight relationship
with recoverability.

17
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:41,830
Not only should it be possible
to recover from an error,

18
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:45,040
the system should tell you exactly
how to recover from an error.

19
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:47,530
That's feedback in response to errors.

20
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:50,310
For Constantine and Lockwood,
this is the feedback principle.

21
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:52,330
The design should keep users
informed of actions or

22
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:56,490
interpretations, changes of state or
condition, and errors or exceptions...

23
00:00:56,490 --> 00:01:00,580
through clear, concise, and
unambiguous language familiar to users.

24
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:03,945
Again, the old Windows blue screen
of death doesn't do this very well.

25
00:01:03,945 --> 00:01:06,790
Because the language is not familiar,
it's not concise, and

26
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:09,230
it doesn't actually tell you
what the state or condition is.

27
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:12,030
The new one does a much
better job of this.

28
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:15,770
Notice as well that Norman, Constantine,
and Lockwood are interested in feedback

29
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:18,760
more generally,
not just in response to errors.

30
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:22,410
That's so fundamental that we have
an entire lesson on feedback cycles

31
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:26,280
that really is more emblematic of
the overall principle of feedback.

32
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:29,260
Here we're most interested in
feedback in response to errors,

33
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:31,040
which is a very important
concept on its own
