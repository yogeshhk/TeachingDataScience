1
00:00:00,408 --> 00:00:02,360
Norman and
Nielsen both talk about the need for

2
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:06,020
a mapping between interfaces and
their effects in the world.

3
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:09,780
Norman notes that mapping is actually
a technical term coming from mathematics

4
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:13,390
that means a relationship between
the elements of two sets of things.

5
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:16,207
In this case, our two sets
are the interface and the world.

6
00:00:16,207 --> 00:00:20,920
For example, these book icons
might help you map these quotes

7
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:22,310
to the books from which they were taken.

8
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:27,480
Nielsen describes mapping by saying the
system should speak the users' language,

9
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,060
with words, phrases, and

10
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:33,668
concepts that are familiar to the user,
rather than system-oriented terms.

11
00:00:33,668 --> 00:00:37,810
Follow real-world conventions, making
information appear in a natural and

12
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:39,280
logical order.

13
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,260
A great example of this,
is the fact that we call cut, copy, and

14
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:45,240
paste, cut, copy and paste.

15
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:48,090
Surely there could have been more
technical terms like duplicate instead

16
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:49,030
of copy.

17
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:52,300
But using cut, copy, and paste
forms a natural mapping between our

18
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:54,770
own vocabulary and
what happens in the system.

19
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:58,450
Note that these two principles
are subtly different, but

20
00:00:58,450 --> 00:01:00,575
they're actually strongly related.

21
00:01:00,575 --> 00:01:03,120
Nielsen's heuristic
describes the general goal,

22
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,510
while Norman's principle
describes one way to achieve it.

23
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:10,300
Strong mappings help make information
appear in natural and logical order.

24
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:14,620
A great example of this is setting
the arrangement of different monitors.

25
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:17,620
This actually comes from my
display in my home office.

26
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:20,490
This visualization creates a very
natural mapping between the way

27
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:22,390
the system treats the monitors, and

28
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:24,600
they way they're actually
laid out in the world.

29
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:25,470
If there's a mismatch, or

30
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:28,970
if something doesn't make sense, I can
easily look at this and map it with

31
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:31,920
the arrangement of the monitors in front
of me and figure out what's going on.

32
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:36,127
This could instead be shown as
just a list of pixel locations.

33
00:01:36,127 --> 00:01:39,152
And that would still present all
the exact same information, but

34
00:01:39,152 --> 00:01:42,820
in a way that isn't as easily
mapped out to the real world.

35
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:46,370
Now, mappings and
affordances are similar principles, but

36
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:47,850
they have a clear and
important difference.

37
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:51,710
We can see that difference
in our color meter again.

38
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:54,810
Affordances were about creating
interfaces where their designs suggested

39
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:56,610
how they're supposed to be used.

40
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:59,285
The placement of this notch
along this horizontal bar,

41
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:01,810
kind of affords the idea that
it could be dragged around.

42
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:04,600
The horizontal bar visualizes the space

43
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:08,380
which makes it seem like we could move
that notch around to set our color.

44
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:12,870
However, that design on its own wouldn't
necessarily create a good mapping.

45
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:15,951
Imagine, if instead of the bar
fading from white to black,

46
00:02:15,951 --> 00:02:17,685
it was just white the entire way.

47
00:02:17,685 --> 00:02:20,900
It would still be very obvious
how you're supposed to use it.

48
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:24,390
But it wouldn't be obvious what the
effect of using it would actually be.

49
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:26,880
It's the present of that
fade from white to black

50
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:30,400
that makes it easier to see what will
happen if I actually drag that around.

51
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,250
I can imagine it's going to make
the colors fade from white to black.

52
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:38,410
That creates the mapping to the effect
of dragging it around on that meter.

53
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:40,850
So mapping refers to creating interfaces

54
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:44,440
where the design makes it clear what
the effect will be when using them,

55
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:48,020
not just creating interfaces where it's
clear how you're supposed to use them.

56
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:51,790
With this color meter, the arrangement
of the controls makes clear what to do

57
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:55,070
and the visualization underneath, makes
it clear what will happen when I do it.
