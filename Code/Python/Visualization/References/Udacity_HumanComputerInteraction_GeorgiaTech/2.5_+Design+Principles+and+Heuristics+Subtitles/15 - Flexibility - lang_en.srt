1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,890
Depending on your expertise with the computers,

2
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:03,660
there's a strong chance you found yourself on

3
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:05,790
one side or the other of the following exchange.

4
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:09,010
Imagine, one person is watching another person use a computer.

5
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:14,055
The person using the computer repeatedly right-clicks and selects cut to cut things,

6
00:00:14,055 --> 00:00:17,445
and then right-click, and selects Paste to paste them back again.

7
00:00:17,445 --> 00:00:21,510
The person watching insists that they can just use Control X and Control

8
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:25,725
V. The person working doesn't understand why the person watching cares.

9
00:00:25,725 --> 00:00:28,140
The person watching doesn't understand why

10
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:30,705
the person working what use the more efficient method.

11
00:00:30,705 --> 00:00:33,075
In reality, they're both right.

12
00:00:33,075 --> 00:00:35,175
This is the principle of flexibility.

13
00:00:35,175 --> 00:00:38,580
These two options are available because of the principle of flexibility,

14
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:42,080
from both Nielsen's heuristics and the principles of universal design.

15
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:45,725
Nielsen specifically comments on the use of accelerators, which are hotkeys.

16
00:00:45,725 --> 00:00:49,970
He says that accelerators may often speed up the interaction for the expert user,

17
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:54,230
such that the system can cater to both inexperienced and experienced users.

18
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:57,965
He advises that we allow users to tailor frequent actions.

19
00:00:57,965 --> 00:01:00,350
Universal design says something similar.

20
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:02,375
They noted that the design should accommodate

21
00:01:02,375 --> 00:01:05,869
a wide range of individual preferences and abilities.

22
00:01:05,869 --> 00:01:08,930
Another set of design principles from Dicks et al also

23
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:11,810
have a category of principles called Flexibility Principles,

24
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:16,570
that advocate user customizability in supporting multiple designs for the same task.

25
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:21,260
Here, Nielsen is most interested in catering to both novice and expert users.

26
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:23,960
While the principles of universal design are more interested

27
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:26,870
in accommodating users of various abilities and preferences.

28
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:29,975
But the underlying principle here is the same, flexibility.

29
00:01:29,975 --> 00:01:31,970
Wherever possible, we should support

30
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:34,820
the different interactions in which people engage naturally,

31
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:38,900
rather than forcing them into one against their expertise or against their preference.
