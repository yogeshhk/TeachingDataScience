1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:04,146
Ease and comfort are two similar ideas
that come from the principles of

2
00:00:04,146 --> 00:00:05,179
universal design.

3
00:00:05,179 --> 00:00:07,140
And they also relate to
equitable treatment,

4
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:10,030
specifically in terms of
physical interaction.

5
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:13,750
The ease principle, which interestingly
uses the word comfort, says the design

6
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:18,040
can be used efficiently and comfortably
and with a minimum amount of fatigue.

7
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:20,550
The comfort principle notes
that appropriate size and

8
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:23,930
space is provided for approach,
reach, manipulation and

9
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:29,010
use regardless of the user's body size,
posture or mobility.

10
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:29,781
Now, in the past,

11
00:00:29,781 --> 00:00:32,781
these principles didn't have an enormous
amount of application to HCI.

12
00:00:32,781 --> 00:00:35,618
Because we generally assume that
the user was sitting at their desk with

13
00:00:35,618 --> 00:00:37,240
a keyboard and a monitor.

14
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:39,880
But as more and more interfaces
are becoming equipped with computers,

15
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:42,870
we'll find HCI dealing with
these issues more and more.

16
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:46,040
For example, the seat control in your
car might now actually be run be

17
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:48,080
a computer that remembers
your settings and

18
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:50,250
restores them when you
get back in the car.

19
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:53,330
That's an instance of HCI
trying to improve user ease and

20
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:55,680
comfort in a physical area.

21
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,630
Mobile interfaces are great
examples of this as well.

22
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:01,310
When deciding the size of
buttons on a mobile interface,

23
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:04,129
we should take into consideration that
some users might have tremors that

24
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:07,480
make it more difficult to interact
precisely with different buttons.

25
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:10,690
As we get into areas like wearable
computing and virtual reality,

26
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:13,950
these issues of ease and comfort are
going to become more and more pertinent.
