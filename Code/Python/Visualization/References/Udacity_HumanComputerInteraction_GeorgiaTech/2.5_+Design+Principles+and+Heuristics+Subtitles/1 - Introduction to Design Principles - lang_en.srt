00:00:06,242 --> 00:00:09,958
Over the many years of HCI development,
experts have come up with a wide variety

3
00:00:09,958 --> 00:00:13,550
of principles and heuristics for
designing good interfaces.

4
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:16,420
None of these are hard and fast rules
like the law of gravity or something.

5
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:20,330
But they're useful guidelines to keep
in mind when designing our interfaces.

6
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:21,420
Likely, the most popular and

7
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:24,420
influential of these is Don Norman's
six principles of design.

8
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:28,280
Larry Constantine and Lucy Lockwood
have a a similar set of principles of

9
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:32,439
user interface design, with some
overlaps but also some distinctions.

10
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:34,720
Jacob Nielsen has a set
of Ten Heuristics for

11
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:38,000
user interface design that can be
used for both design and evaluation.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
And while those are all interested
in general usability, there also

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,800
exists a set of seven principles
called Principles of Universal Design.

14
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:48,720
These are similarly concerned with
usability, but more specifically for

15
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:51,028
the greatest number of people.

16
00:00:51,028 --> 00:00:54,720
Putting these four sets together, we'll
talk about 15 unique principles for

17
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:55,430
interaction design.
