1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:01,220
Well, what do we know?

2
00:00:02,230 --> 00:00:03,660
We know the car was off.

3
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:06,280
We know this is clearly the power
button based on how it's labeled and

4
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:07,680
where it's located.

5
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:08,410
And most importantly,

6
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:12,570
when I pressed it we heard kind
of a happy confirmation-y sound.

7
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:13,395
So did the car turn on?

8
00:00:14,425 --> 00:00:15,535
Actually, it didn't.

9
00:00:15,535 --> 00:00:17,485
To turn this car on you
have press the brake petal

10
00:00:17,485 --> 00:00:19,235
while pressing the on button.

11
00:00:19,235 --> 00:00:21,455
The car doesn't do a great job
of helping us across that goal

12
00:00:21,455 --> 00:00:22,555
of execution.

13
00:00:22,555 --> 00:00:25,495
There's no indicator that you're doing
it wrong until you've actually already

14
00:00:25,495 --> 00:00:26,625
done it wrong.

15
00:00:26,625 --> 00:00:29,545
But the car does give us
a short gulf of evaluation.

16
00:00:29,545 --> 00:00:32,755
If you do it incorrectly, an alert pops
up on the dashboard letting you know you

17
00:00:32,755 --> 00:00:35,545
need to press the brake pedal and
then press the on button.

18
00:00:35,545 --> 00:00:38,210
The output presented
is easy to interpret.

19
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:41,620
As presented in the context of when
you need to know that information, so

20
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:45,120
you kind of understand that it’s
a response to what you just did.

21
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,590
So here we have some trouble
with the gulf of execution but

22
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:49,970
the gulf of evaluation
is still pretty short.

23
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:52,850
So now that I see this message
I press down the brake pedal,

24
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:58,300
press the on button [SOUND]
and now the car is on.
