1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,785
The second challenge is for the task to express to the user through the interface,

2
00:00:04,785 --> 00:00:07,650
the output of the actions that the user took.

3
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:11,520
This is called the Gulf of Evaluation because the user needs to

4
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:15,855
evaluate the new state of the system in response to the actions they took.

5
00:00:15,855 --> 00:00:17,610
Like the Gulf of Execution,

6
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:20,055
we can think of this in terms of three parts.

7
00:00:20,055 --> 00:00:23,595
There's the actual physical form of the output from the interface,

8
00:00:23,595 --> 00:00:25,860
what did it actually do in response?

9
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:27,390
There might be something visual,

10
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:29,039
there might be a sound, a vibration,

11
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:30,390
some kind of output.

12
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:32,460
The second is interpretation.

13
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:36,140
Can the user interpret the real meaning of that output.

14
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:38,415
You might think of this in terms of a smartphone.

15
00:00:38,415 --> 00:00:40,590
If a smart phone vibrates in your pocket,

16
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:42,920
can you interpret what the meaning of that output

17
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:46,180
was or do you have to pull the phone out and actually see?

18
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:48,870
Then the third phase is evaluation.

19
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:51,380
Can the user use that interpretation to

20
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:54,260
evaluate whether or not their goals were accomplished?

21
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:56,390
You can imagine submitting a form online.

22
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:59,360
It might give you output that you interpret to mean that the form was

23
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:01,220
received but you might not be able to

24
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:04,040
evaluate whether or not the form was actually accepted.

25
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:06,680
Once they've received and interpreted that output,

26
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:09,470
the final step is to evaluate whether or not

27
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:13,745
that interpretation means that their goals were actually realized within the system.

28
00:01:13,745 --> 00:01:16,715
Take our on-demand video service example again.

29
00:01:16,715 --> 00:01:19,910
Imagine that the user has gotten all the way to finding the program that they

30
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:23,215
want to watch and they've press the play button on the remote.

31
00:01:23,215 --> 00:01:25,480
Imagine the interface responds by hiding

32
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:28,630
the menus that they were using to navigate amongst the service.

33
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:31,030
Can they interpret the meaning of that output?

34
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:32,740
Can they evaluate whether or not

35
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:35,440
that interpretation means that their goals were realized?

36
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:37,475
If they're a novice user maybe not,

37
00:01:37,475 --> 00:01:40,030
an expert might correctly interpreted the screen

38
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:43,240
blacking out is because the service is trying to load the video,

39
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:45,370
they then evaluate that interpretation

40
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:47,499
and determined that their goals have been realized,

41
00:01:47,499 --> 00:01:49,775
but the service is trying to play the show they want to watch.

42
00:01:49,775 --> 00:01:51,850
But a novice user might interpret

43
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:54,850
that output to mean that the service has stopped working at all,

44
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:57,670
like when your computer just shuts down and the screen goes black.

45
00:01:57,670 --> 00:02:02,195
They then incorrectly evaluate that their goals were not actually realized in the system.

46
00:02:02,195 --> 00:02:05,725
We might get over this by showing some kind of buffering icon.

47
00:02:05,725 --> 00:02:09,410
That's a different kind of output from the system that helps the user correctly

48
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:13,655
interpret that the system is still working on the actions that they put in.

49
00:02:13,655 --> 00:02:18,410
They then can evaluate that maybe their goals were correctly realized after all,

50
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:21,260
because the system is still working to bring up their show.

51
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:26,280
So, as you can see, each of these three stages presents some unique challenges.
