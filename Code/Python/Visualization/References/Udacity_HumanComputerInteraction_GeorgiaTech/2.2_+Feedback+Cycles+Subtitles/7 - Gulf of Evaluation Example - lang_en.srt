1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,380
Let's take a thermostat, for example.

2
00:00:02,380 --> 00:00:04,830
I have a goal to make the room warmer,
so

3
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:08,470
I do something to my thermostat with
the intention of making the room warmer.

4
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:10,330
What does the system do as a result?

5
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:14,300
Well, it turns the heat on, that would
be the successful result of my action.

6
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:16,585
But how do I know that
the heat was turned on?

7
00:00:16,585 --> 00:00:19,067
Well, maybe I can hear it,
I might hear it click on.

8
00:00:19,067 --> 00:00:21,230
But that's a one time kind of thing and
it might be quiet.

9
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:24,490
And if I'm mishearing it,
I have no way of double checking it.

10
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:26,590
So I'm not sure if I heard it,
and I have to go find a vent and

11
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:29,650
put my hand on it and
try to feel the heat coming out.

12
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:31,590
And there's more going on in a heater,
it might have worked,

13
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:35,270
but the heater doesn't immediately
turn on for one reason or the other.

14
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:38,130
These are signs of a large
gulf of evaluation.

15
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:41,310
Neither the sound or the vent are
optimal displays because they're either

16
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:43,680
hard to reach or possible to miss.

17
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,860
Feeling the heat might be
easy to interpret, but

18
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:47,910
hearing the heater turn on might not.

19
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:50,620
So either way, I have to do
a lot to evaluate whether or

20
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:52,580
not my action was successful.

21
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:54,890
And this is all for
a very small piece of feedback.

22
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:58,700
Ideally if I wasn't successful, we want
the system to also tell me why I wasn't

23
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:02,840
successful so I can evaluate what I
did wrong and respond accordingly.

24
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:06,390
There's a very large gulf of evaluation
if there's no indicator on the actual

25
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:07,140
thermostat.

26
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:09,410
So how can we resolve that?

27
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:10,580
Well, simple.

28
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:13,120
We just mark on the thermostat
that the heat is on.

29
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,440
That sounds trivial, but

30
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:18,490
nothing in the fundamental design of
this system demanded a note like this.

31
00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:21,830
It's only in thinking about the system
from the perspective of the user

32
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:23,790
that we find that need.

33
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:27,260
I can let you know as well,
this system still isn't very ideal.

34
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:28,970
For various reasons,
it'll turn the heater on or

35
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:32,070
the air conditioning off even when it
hasn't reached the temperature I put in.

36
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:34,560
And it gives me no indication of why.

37
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,286
I can look at the system and evaluate
that the temperature is set to lower

38
00:01:37,286 --> 00:01:38,931
than the current
temperature in the room.

39
00:01:38,931 --> 00:01:42,410
But at the same time,
I can see that the heater isn't on.

40
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:45,445
Under those circumstances,
I have no way of knowing if the heater's

41
00:01:45,445 --> 00:01:48,870
malfunctioning, if the switch is wrong,
or I don't even know.

42
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:52,951
In this case, it might just be
that it's set to the wrong mode.

43
00:01:52,951 --> 00:01:55,709
The mode is visible, but
after I remembered to check it,

44
00:01:55,709 --> 00:01:57,385
it appears to be malfunctioning.

45
00:01:57,385 --> 00:02:00,447
We can imagine an alternative message
on the screen indicating the direction

46
00:02:00,447 --> 00:02:03,506
of the relationship or something similar
that would give some sign that it's

47
00:02:03,506 --> 00:02:04,700
currently set incorrectly.
