1
00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:03,190
It's not a coincidence that I'm
filming this in my basement.

2
00:00:03,190 --> 00:00:05,150
This actually happened
to me a few weeks ago.

3
00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:08,029
The circuit to our basement was tripped,
which is where we keep our modem, so

4
00:00:08,029 --> 00:00:09,100
our internet was out.

5
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:12,270
Now this is a brand new house and it was
the first time we tripped a breaker, so

6
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:14,950
I pulled out my flashlight and
I opened the panel.

7
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:17,760
And none of the labels over here clearly
corresponded to the breaker I was

8
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,140
looking for over here.

9
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:22,180
I ended up trying every single one
of them and still it didn't work.

10
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:23,940
I shut off everything in the house.

11
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:25,460
Why didn't it work?

12
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:26,360
In reality,

13
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,810
there was a reset button on the outlet
itself that had to be pressed.

14
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:31,200
The only reason we noticed it was
because my wife noticed something out of

15
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,620
the corner of her eye turning on and
off as I switched these.

16
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:35,940
That was a terribly
large gulf of execution.

17
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:38,030
I knew what I wanted to accomplish,

18
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:41,230
I could translate it into the system's
terms easily, reset a breaker.

19
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:44,600
But figuring out the actions to
accomplish that goal was very difficult.

20
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,080
That's a large gulf of execution.

21
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,769
How was that?

22
00:00:47,769 --> 00:00:50,479
>> [SOUND] What?

23
00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:52,837
Sorry, I wasn't paying attention.

24
00:00:52,837 --> 00:00:54,115
>> You weren't watching?

25
00:00:54,115 --> 00:00:56,810
[LAUGH] So I have no way of
knowing if that was good or not?

26
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:00,050
Isn't that a terrible
gulf of evaluation?

27
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:02,320
I joke, but a lack of feedback
on your performance at a task,

28
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,360
whether it be filming, like I'm doing
now or doing a project like you’ll

29
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:09,100
do later in our material, presents the
same kind of poor gulf of evaluation.
