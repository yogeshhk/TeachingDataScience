1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:02,130
There are a few things we could do here.

2
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:04,850
We might build some kind of
buzzer into the card reader to

3
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:06,800
let the customer know when
they can take their card out.

4
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:08,675
That would make sure that
they don't leave without it.

5
00:00:08,675 --> 00:00:10,392
ATM machines often do this, actually.

6
00:00:10,392 --> 00:00:13,327
They'll ring a buzzer until the card and
the cash are removed.

7
00:00:13,327 --> 00:00:15,377
But that's noisy and
potentially irritating.

8
00:00:15,377 --> 00:00:18,700
It would mess with the ambiance of
a restaurant or something like that.

9
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:20,120
We could do something super complicated,

10
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:22,120
like pair the credit card
with a smartphone and

11
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:24,430
ring the phone when it gets too
far away from the credit card.

12
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:27,860
But that requires adding some new
technology to every single credit card,

13
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:29,440
which could be a pretty big expense.

14
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,640
So what about something simpler?

15
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:35,070
Why not force a customer to remove the
credit card in order to get the receipt

16
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:36,272
and their goods?

17
00:00:36,272 --> 00:00:38,415
Unless they're going to walk away
without what they came to buy,

18
00:00:38,415 --> 00:00:40,220
that'll ensure that they
remember their card.
