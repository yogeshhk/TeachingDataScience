00:00:02,990 --> 00:00:07,050
Here are five quick tips for bridging gulfs of evaluation.

2
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:09,884
Number one; give feedback constantly.

3
00:00:09,884 --> 00:00:12,180
Don't automatically wait for whatever the user did to be

4
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:14,595
processed in the system before giving feedback.

5
00:00:14,595 --> 00:00:16,680
Give them feedback that the input was received.

6
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:18,975
Give them feedback on what input was received.

7
00:00:18,975 --> 00:00:21,750
Help the user understand where the system is in executing

8
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:25,199
their action by giving feedback at every step of the process.

9
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:28,274
Number two; give feedback immediately.

10
00:00:28,274 --> 00:00:30,060
Let the user know they've been heard even when you're

11
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:31,920
not ready to give them a four response yet.

12
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,720
If they tap an icon to open an app,

13
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:36,315
there should be immediate feedback just on that tap.

14
00:00:36,315 --> 00:00:38,550
That way even if the app takes a while to open,

15
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:41,080
the user knows that the phone recognize their input.

16
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:44,420
That's why icons briefly gray out when you tap them on your phone.

17
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:48,115
Number three; match the feedback to the action.

18
00:00:48,115 --> 00:00:51,020
It might seem like this amount of constant immediate feedback would get

19
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:54,095
annoying and if executed poorly, it really would.

20
00:00:54,095 --> 00:00:56,345
Subtle actions should have subtle feedback.

21
00:00:56,345 --> 00:00:59,105
Significant actions should have significant feedback.

22
00:00:59,105 --> 00:01:02,260
Number four; vary your feedback.

23
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:05,490
It's often tempting to view our designs as existing solely on a screen,

24
00:01:05,490 --> 00:01:07,955
and so we want to give the feedback on the screen.

25
00:01:07,955 --> 00:01:10,380
But the screen is where the interaction is taking place,

26
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:12,740
so visual feedback can actually get in the way.

27
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:15,170
Think about how auditory or haptic feedback can

28
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:17,915
be used instead of relying just on visual feedback.

29
00:01:17,915 --> 00:01:21,105
Number five; leverage direct manipulation.

30
00:01:21,105 --> 00:01:23,760
We talked about this a lot more, but whenever possible,

31
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:27,020
let the user feel like they're directly manipulating things in the system.

32
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:30,170
Things like dragging stuff around or pulling something to make it larger or smaller,

33
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:32,810
are very intuitive actions because they feel like they're

34
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:36,260
interacting directly with the content. Use that.

35
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:38,900
Again, we talk far more about this in another lesson,

36
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:40,735
but it's worth mentioning here as well.

37
00:01:40,735 --> 00:01:43,340
By loading these things into your short-term memory several times,

38
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:45,860
we hope to help solidify them in your long-term memory.

39
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:50,420
That relationship is actually something we also talk about elsewhere in this unit.
