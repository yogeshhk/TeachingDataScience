1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,650
Before we begin, there's some vocabulary we need to cover to understand evaluation.

2
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:08,805
These things especially applied to the data that we gathered during evaluation.

3
00:00:08,805 --> 00:00:11,890
While there are particularly relevant for gathering quantitative data,

4
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:14,925
they're useful in discussing or other kinds of data as well.

5
00:00:14,925 --> 00:00:17,250
The first term is reliability.

6
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:20,010
Reliability refers to whether or not some assessment

7
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:22,395
of some phenomenon is consistent over time.

8
00:00:22,395 --> 00:00:25,290
So for example, Amanda what time is it?

9
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:27,420
It's about 2:30.

10
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:31,605
Amanda what time is it? It's about 2:30.

11
00:00:31,605 --> 00:00:34,620
Amanda, what time is it? It's 2:30.

12
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:38,055
Amanda is a very reliable assessment of the time.

13
00:00:38,055 --> 00:00:40,845
Every time I asked, she gives me the same time.

14
00:00:40,845 --> 00:00:42,920
We want that in an assessment measure.

15
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:45,350
We want it to be reliable across multiple trials.

16
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:49,280
Otherwise, its conclusions are random and just not very useful.

17
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,605
A second principle is validity.

18
00:00:51,605 --> 00:00:55,160
Validity refers to how accurately and assessment measures reality.

19
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:59,405
An assessment could be completely reliable but completely inaccurate.

20
00:00:59,405 --> 00:01:01,850
So for example, Amanda, what time is it?

21
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:04,150
Oh my goodness, it's 2:30!

22
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:07,015
Actually it's 1:30. Oh, shoot!

23
00:01:07,015 --> 00:01:09,440
So while Amanda was a reliable timekeeper,

24
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:11,225
she wasn't a very valid one.

25
00:01:11,225 --> 00:01:14,450
Her time wasn't correct even though it was consistent.

26
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:18,725
Validity is closely connected to a principle called generalizability.

27
00:01:18,725 --> 00:01:22,040
Generalizability is the extent to which we can apply lessons we learned

28
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:25,310
in our evaluation to broader audiences of people.

29
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:28,910
So for example, we might find that the kinds of people that volunteer for

30
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:32,645
usability studies have different preferences than the regular user.

31
00:01:32,645 --> 00:01:35,240
So the conclusions we find that those volunteers might

32
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:37,880
not be generalizable in measuring what we want

33
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:43,385
to measure.Finally one last term we want to know is to understand its precision.

34
00:01:43,385 --> 00:01:47,240
Precision is a measurement of how specific some assessment is.

35
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:49,520
So for example, Amanda, what time is it?

36
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,685
Well apparently, it's 1:30.

37
00:01:51,685 --> 00:01:54,945
Actually, it's 1:31. Come on!

38
00:01:54,945 --> 00:01:57,050
But in this case, no one's really going to say that

39
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:59,375
Amanda was wrong in saying that it was 1:30.

40
00:01:59,375 --> 00:02:01,190
She just wasn't as precise.

41
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:04,790
I could just as accurately say it's 1:31:27,

42
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:07,535
but that's probably more precision than we need.

43
00:02:07,535 --> 00:02:11,225
As we describe the different kinds of data we can gather during evaluation,

44
00:02:11,225 --> 00:02:12,830
keep these things in mind.

45
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:15,350
If we were to conduct the same procedure again,

46
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:17,375
how likely is it that we'd get the same results?

47
00:02:17,375 --> 00:02:20,870
That's reliability. How accurately does our data actually

48
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:24,620
capture the real world phenomenon that we care about? That's validity.

49
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:28,925
To what extent can we apply these conclusions to people that weren't in the evaluation?

50
00:02:28,925 --> 00:02:30,905
That's generalizability.

51
00:02:30,905 --> 00:02:35,800
How specific are our conclusions and observations? That's precision.
