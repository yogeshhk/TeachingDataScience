00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,590
Qualitative evaluation involves getting qualitative feedback from the user.

2
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:06,990
There are a lot of qualitative questions we want to ask

3
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:09,480
throughout the design process. What did you like?

4
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:13,200
What did you dislike? What were you thinking while using this interface?

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,140
What was your goal when you took that particular action?

6
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:17,760
Now, if this sounds familiar,

7
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,260
it's because it should be.

8
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:22,380
The methods we use for qualitative evaluation are very

9
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:25,770
similar to the methods we used for need-finding: interviews,

10
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:29,670
think-aloud protocols, focus groups, surveys, post-event protocols.

11
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:33,870
We use those methods to get information about the task in the first place, and now,

12
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:38,360
we can use these techniques to get feedback on how our prototype changes the task.
