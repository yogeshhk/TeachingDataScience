1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,620
There are a lot of ways
to evaluate interfaces.

2
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:05,280
So to organize our
discussion of evaluation,

3
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:07,840
I've broken these into three categories.

4
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:10,520
The first is qualitative evaluation.

5
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:13,520
This is where we want to get
qualitative feedback from users.

6
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:17,120
What do they like, what do they dislike,
what's easy, what's hard.

7
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:20,210
We'll get that information through some
methods very similar, in fact identical,

8
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:22,430
to our methods for need finding.

9
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:24,900
The second is empirical evaluation.

10
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,864
This is where we actually want to
do some controlled experiments and

11
00:00:27,864 --> 00:00:30,360
evaluate the results quantitatively.

12
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:32,630
For that,
we need many more participants, and

13
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:37,040
we also want to make sure we addressed
the big qualitative feedback first.

14
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,800
The third is predictive evaluation.

15
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:43,740
Predictive evaluation is specifically
evaluation without users.

16
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:45,080
In user centered design,

17
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:48,610
this is obviously not our
favorite kind of evaluation.

18
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:50,840
Evaluation with real users
though is oftentimes slow and

19
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,220
its really expensive.

20
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:53,000
So it's useful for

21
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,350
us to have ways we can do some simple
evaluation on a day to day basis.

22
00:00:56,350 --> 00:01:00,270
So we'll structure our discussion of
evaluation around these three general

23
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:00,990
categories.
