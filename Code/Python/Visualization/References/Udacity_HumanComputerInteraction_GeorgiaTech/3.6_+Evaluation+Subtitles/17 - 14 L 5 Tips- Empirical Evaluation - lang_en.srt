00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:06,915
Here are five quick tips for doing empirical evaluations.

2
00:00:06,915 --> 00:00:10,440
You can actually take entire classes on doing empirical evaluations,

3
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:12,750
but these tips should get you started.

4
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:15,750
Number one, control what you can,

5
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:17,520
document what you can't.

6
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,340
Try to make your treatments as identical as possible.

7
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:23,205
However, if there are systematic differences between them,

8
00:00:23,205 --> 00:00:25,245
document and report that.

9
00:00:25,245 --> 00:00:28,590
Number two, limit your variables.

10
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:30,600
It can be tempting to try to vary lots of

11
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,985
different things and monitor lots of other things,

12
00:00:32,985 --> 00:00:35,220
but that just leads to noisy difficult data

13
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:37,860
that will probably generate some false conclusions.

14
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,070
Instead, focus on varying

15
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:43,955
only one or two things and monitor only a handful of things in response.

16
00:00:43,955 --> 00:00:46,280
There's nothing at all wrong with only modifying

17
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:49,220
one variable and only monitoring one variable.

18
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:53,565
Number three, work backwards in designing your experiment.

19
00:00:53,565 --> 00:00:55,955
A counter state that I've seen is just to

20
00:00:55,955 --> 00:00:58,985
gather a bunch of data and figure out how to analyze it later.

21
00:00:58,985 --> 00:01:02,620
That's messy, and it doesn't lead to very reliable conclusions.

22
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:05,560
Decide at the start what question you want to answer,

23
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:07,895
then decide the analysis you need to use,

24
00:01:07,895 --> 00:01:10,650
and then decide the data that you need to gather.

25
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:14,350
Number four, script your analyses in advance.

26
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:15,955
Ronald Coase once said,

27
00:01:15,955 --> 00:01:17,730
"If you torture the data long enough,

28
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:19,714
nature will always confess."

29
00:01:19,714 --> 00:01:24,260
What the quote means is If we analyze and reanalyze data enough times,

30
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:26,150
we can always find conclusions,

31
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:28,535
but that doesn't mean that they're actually there.

32
00:01:28,535 --> 00:01:32,230
So, decide in advance what analysis you'll do and do it.

33
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:34,460
If it doesn't give you the results that you want,

34
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:37,910
don't just keep reanalyzing that same data until it does.

35
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:41,510
Number five, pay attention to power.

36
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:45,520
Power refers to the size of the difference that a test can detect.

37
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,950
Generally, it's very dependent on how many participants you have.

38
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:51,680
If you want to detect only a small effect,

39
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,735
then you'll need a lot of participants.

40
00:01:53,735 --> 00:01:56,150
If you only care about detecting a big effect,

41
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:58,530
you can usually get by with fewer.
