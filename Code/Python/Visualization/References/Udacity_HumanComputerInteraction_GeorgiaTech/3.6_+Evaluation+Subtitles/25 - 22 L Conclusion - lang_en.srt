00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:06,885
In this lesson, we've discussed the basics of evaluation.

2
00:00:06,885 --> 00:00:09,660
Evaluation is a massive topic to cover though.

3
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:11,780
You could take entire classes on evaluation.

4
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:15,870
Heck, you could take entire classes only on specific types of evaluation.

5
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:18,540
Our goal here has been to give you enough information

6
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:21,390
to know what to look into further and when.

7
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:24,884
We want you to understand when to use qualitative evaluation,

8
00:00:24,884 --> 00:00:26,790
when to use empirical evaluation,

9
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:28,965
and when to use predictive evaluation.

10
00:00:28,965 --> 00:00:31,499
We want you to understand within those categories,

11
00:00:31,499 --> 00:00:33,420
what the different options are.

12
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:36,285
That way, when you're ready to begin evaluation,

13
00:00:36,285 --> 00:00:38,190
you know what you should look into doing.
