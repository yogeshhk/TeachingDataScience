1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,300
Once we have a solid understanding of the user and the task,

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:06,255
we want to start brainstorming possible designs.

3
00:00:06,255 --> 00:00:10,455
The important thing here is to make sure we don't get fixated on one idea too early.

4
00:00:10,455 --> 00:00:11,880
That's sort of tunnel vision,

5
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:14,475
risks missing lots of fantastic ideas.

6
00:00:14,475 --> 00:00:18,190
So, we want to make sure to engage in a well-defined brainstorming process.

7
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:21,260
I personally recommend that we start with individual brainstorming,

8
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:23,460
and then set up a group brainstorming session that

9
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:26,625
ensures that everyone's individual ideas gets heard.

10
00:00:26,625 --> 00:00:29,610
From there, we propose some different ideas on how to

11
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:32,670
explore those design alternatives through methods like personas,

12
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:34,575
and scenarios, and timelines.

13
00:00:34,575 --> 00:00:37,020
Our end goal here was to arrive at a set of

14
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:40,590
designs worth moving on to the prototyping stage.
