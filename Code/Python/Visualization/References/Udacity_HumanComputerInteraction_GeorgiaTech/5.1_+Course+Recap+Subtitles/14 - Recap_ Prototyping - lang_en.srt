1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
In user-centered design, our goal is to get user feedback early and often.

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:06,970
So, once we have some design alternatives,

3
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:10,350
our goal is to get them in front of users as quickly as possible.

4
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:12,750
That's the prototyping stage where we take

5
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:17,025
those design alternatives and build prototypes we can show to actual users.

6
00:00:17,025 --> 00:00:20,020
Now at first, this prototypes might be very low fidelity.

7
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:23,400
We might start just by describing our ideas or drawing them on paper.

8
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:26,175
Those are verbal or paper prototypes.

9
00:00:26,175 --> 00:00:28,590
We want to keep our designs easy to revise.

10
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:31,455
We might even revise them live while working with users.

11
00:00:31,455 --> 00:00:33,750
As we get more and more feedback,

12
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:38,495
we build higher fidelity prototypes to explore more detailed questions about our designs.

13
00:00:38,495 --> 00:00:42,595
We might use wireframes or set up live simulated demos.

14
00:00:42,595 --> 00:00:44,360
At every stage of the process,

15
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:46,670
we design our prototypes in a way to get

16
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:50,970
the user's feedback and inform the next iteration of our design life cycle.
