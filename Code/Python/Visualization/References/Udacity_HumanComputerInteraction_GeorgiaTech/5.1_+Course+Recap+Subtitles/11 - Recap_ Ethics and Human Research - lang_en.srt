00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,205
When we're doing research in HCI,

2
00:00:02,205 --> 00:00:06,105
we have access to some pretty sensitive personal data about our participants.

3
00:00:06,105 --> 00:00:09,840
There are huge ethical considerations about privacy and coercion,

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,395
that we have to keep in mind when participating in the design lifecycle.

5
00:00:13,395 --> 00:00:16,620
So, we discussed the role of institutional review board,

6
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:19,320
or IRB for university research.

7
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:23,265
They oversee studies and make sure we're preserving our participants rights.

8
00:00:23,265 --> 00:00:27,090
They also make sure that the benefits of our research outweigh the risks,

9
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:30,270
and as part of that they help ensure our methods our sound enough,

10
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:32,340
to have benefits in the first place.

11
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:36,100
We also discussed how industry doesn't have the same kind of oversight.

12
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:39,935
But some companies have partnered with universities to participate in their IRBs.

13
00:00:39,935 --> 00:00:43,370
While other companies have formed their own internal IRBs.

14
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:46,790
All of this is driven by the need to preserve the rights of our users,

15
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:49,830
that's a key part of user-centered design.
