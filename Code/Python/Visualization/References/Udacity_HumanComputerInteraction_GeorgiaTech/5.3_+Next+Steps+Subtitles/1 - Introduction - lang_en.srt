00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:08,100
To close our journey through HCI,

2
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:10,545
let's take a look at where you might go from here.

3
00:00:10,545 --> 00:00:14,115
We've already talked about different application areas of HCI like,

4
00:00:14,115 --> 00:00:16,425
virtual reality in educational technology,

5
00:00:16,425 --> 00:00:19,095
and those certainly apply to what you could do next.

6
00:00:19,095 --> 00:00:22,290
We've also talked elsewhere about the deeper topics in HCI you might

7
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:26,175
investigate like intelligent user interfaces, or Human-Centered Computing.

8
00:00:26,175 --> 00:00:28,170
But to close, let's talk about

9
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:33,020
the formal educational steps you might take going forward to get deeper into HCI.
