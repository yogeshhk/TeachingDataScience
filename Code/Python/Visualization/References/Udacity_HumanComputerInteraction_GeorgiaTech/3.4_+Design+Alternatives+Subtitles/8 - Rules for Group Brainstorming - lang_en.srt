1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,717
To have an effective group brainstorming
session, we need to have some rules to

2
00:00:03,717 --> 00:00:07,058
govern the individual's behavior to
address those common challenges.

3
00:00:07,058 --> 00:00:10,628
In 1957,
Osbourne outline four such rules.

4
00:00:10,628 --> 00:00:13,930
Number one, Expressiveness.

5
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:17,028
Any idea that comes to mind, share
it out loud, no matter how strange.

6
00:00:17,028 --> 00:00:20,660
Number two, nonevaluation.

7
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:24,326
No criticizing ideas,
no evaluating the ideas themselves yet.

8
00:00:24,326 --> 00:00:26,811
Number three, quantity.

9
00:00:26,811 --> 00:00:29,210
Brainstorming as many as possible.

10
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:32,046
The more you have, the greater
your idea of finding a novel idea.

11
00:00:32,046 --> 00:00:35,540
Number four, building.

12
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:37,790
While you shouldn't
criticize other's ideas,

13
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:39,778
you should absolutely
try to build on them.

14
00:00:39,778 --> 00:00:45,333
Then, in 1996, Oxley, Dzindolet and
Paulus presented four additional rules.

15
00:00:45,333 --> 00:00:47,860
Number one, stay focused.

16
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:49,290
Keep the goal in mind at all times.

17
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:53,450
Number two, no explaining ideas.

18
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:55,340
Say the idea and move on.

19
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:57,420
No justifying ideas.

20
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:01,310
Number three, when you hit a roadblock,
revisit the problem.

21
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:02,600
Say it again out loud.

22
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,520
Number four, encourage others.

23
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:09,080
If someone isn't speaking up,
encourage them to do so.

24
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:14,260
Note that all eight of these rules
prescribe what individuals should do,

25
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:17,520
but they're only effective if
every individual does them.

26
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,440
So it's good to cover these rules,
post them publicly, and

27
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:22,050
call one another on breaking from them.
