1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,150
Group brain storming presents
some significant issues.

2
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:07,280
Thompson in 2008 laid out four behaviors
in group brainstorming that can block

3
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:08,730
progress.

4
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:11,170
The first is social loafing.

5
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:14,590
People often don't tend to work as hard
in groups as they would individually.

6
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:16,410
It's easy to feel like
the responsibility for

7
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:19,790
unproductive brainstorming is shared and
deflected.

8
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:23,810
In individual brainstorming,
it's clearly on the individual.

9
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:28,760
The second blocker is conformity,
people in groups tend to want to agree.

10
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:29,702
Studies have shown that

11
00:00:29,702 --> 00:00:31,828
group brainstorming leads
to convergent thinking.

12
00:00:31,828 --> 00:00:35,855
The conversation the group has tends to
force participants down the same line of

13
00:00:35,855 --> 00:00:37,539
thinking, generating fewer and

14
00:00:37,539 --> 00:00:41,230
less varied ideas than
the individuals acting alone.

15
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:42,090
During brainstorming,

16
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:45,680
though, the goal is diversion thinking,
lots of ideas, lots of creativity.

17
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:48,774
The third blocker is
production blocking.

18
00:00:48,774 --> 00:00:52,300
In group brainstorming,
there are often individuals who dominate

19
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:55,840
the conversation and make it difficult
for others to actually be heard.

20
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,930
Their ideas can thus command more
weight, not because of the strength of

21
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:02,370
the ideas, but because of
the volume of the description.

22
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:04,970
The fourth blocker is
performance matching.

23
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:07,986
People tend to converge in terms
of passion and performance,

24
00:01:07,986 --> 00:01:10,248
which can lead to a loss
of momentum over time.

25
00:01:10,248 --> 00:01:13,916
That might be able to get people excited
if they're around other excited people

26
00:01:13,916 --> 00:01:14,682
initially, but

27
00:01:14,682 --> 00:01:18,201
more often than not, it saps the energy
of those who enter with enthusiasm.

28
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,240
In addition to these four challenges,
I would add a fifth.

29
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:26,290
Group brainstorming may also be
prone to power dynamics, or biases.

30
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:29,140
No matter how supportive and
collaborative a boss might be,

31
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:32,960
there'll likely always exist a tacit
pressure to build on her suggestions,

32
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,490
which dampens creative brainstorming.

33
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:38,400
There also exists considerable
literature stating that other biases

34
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:43,400
based on gender, age, race, complain
to these group sessions as well.

35
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,910
Now note that this doesn't mean group
brainstorming should be avoided

36
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:47,145
altogether.

37
00:01:47,145 --> 00:01:50,505
What it means is that we should enter
into group brainstorming with strong

38
00:01:50,505 --> 00:01:53,255
ideas of how to address these issues,
ideally,

39
00:01:53,255 --> 00:01:56,055
after a phase of individual
brainstorming has already occurred.
