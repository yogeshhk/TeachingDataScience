1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,820
The first common method we can use to
flush out design alternatives is called

2
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:04,920
personas.

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:09,220
With personas we create actual
characters to represent our users.

4
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:10,200
So let's create a persona for

5
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:13,340
the problem of helping exercisers
take notes while reading books.

6
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:14,640
We'll start by giving her a name and
a face,

7
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:17,440
and then we'll fill out some details.

8
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,550
We want to understand
who this persona is.

9
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:21,690
We want to be able to
mentally simulate her.

10
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:24,700
We want to be able to say,
what would Anika do in this situation?

11
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:27,200
What is she thinking when
she's about to go exercise?

12
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:28,667
What kind of things might interrupt her?

13
00:00:28,667 --> 00:00:32,100
We might want to put in some more
domain specific information as well.

14
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:34,130
Like, why does this person exercise?

15
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:35,420
When do they exercise?

16
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:36,990
What kind of books do they like?

17
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:38,760
How are they feeling
when they're exercising?

18
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:39,740
Where do they usually exercise?

19
00:00:40,872 --> 00:00:43,830
We want to create at least three or four
of these different personas, and perhaps

20
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:47,390
more depending on how many different
stakeholders we have for our problem.

21
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:50,310
The important thing is that these
should be pretty different people,

22
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:52,370
representing different
elements of our designs,

23
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:56,350
different elements of our task, so
we can explore its entire range.

24
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:59,640
We don't want to design just for
Anika, but we do want to design for

25
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:00,650
real people.

26
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:04,580
And so we should define personas that
represent the range of real people that

27
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:05,870
we care about.

28
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:07,740
That way we can ask our questions like,

29
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:10,680
how would Janet feel about
this design alternative?

30
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,080
Using this,
we can start to extort the space and

31
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:15,030
find the options that
has the most appeal.
