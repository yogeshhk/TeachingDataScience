1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:03,800
The biggest mistake that a designer can
make is jumping straight to designing

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:07,610
an interface without understanding
the users or understanding the task.

3
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:11,190
The second biggest mistake though is
settling on a single design idea or

4
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:14,230
a single genre of
design ideas too early.

5
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:15,909
This can take on multiple forms.

6
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:21,560
One form is staying too allegiant
to existing designs or products.

7
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:23,670
Take the thermostat, for example, again.

8
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:27,090
If you settled on tweaking
the existing design of a thermostat

9
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:28,690
you would never invent the Nest.

10
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:31,370
So if you're working on
improving an existing interface,

11
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:35,020
try to actually distance yourself
from the existing solutions,

12
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:37,860
at least initially during
the brainstorming session.

13
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,130
But this is also a problem if
you're designing interfaces for

14
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:42,040
new tasks as well.

15
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:45,600
Imagine for instance, that while you
were observing people exercising, you

16
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,090
started sketching interface ideas like
how to make the buttons big enough or

17
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:51,420
what buttons need to be
featured prominently.

18
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:55,150
In doing so, you're getting tunnel
vision and missing out on any design

19
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:58,710
alternatives that might involve voice or
gesture control.

20
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:01,500
So the second biggest mistake
you can make is focusing

21
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:04,739
too strongly on one alternative
from the very beginning,

22
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:08,010
instead of exploring the entire range
of possible design alternatives.

23
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:10,840
The reason why this is
such a common mistake,

24
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:14,040
is that there's this natural tendency
to think of it as a waste of

25
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,750
time to develop interfaces you're
not going to end up using.

26
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:20,220
You think you can get it done faster
just by picking one early on and

27
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:21,480
sticking to it.

28
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:24,820
But flushing out ideas for interfaces
you don't end up using isn't a waste of

29
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:28,810
time, because by doing so you continue
to learn more about the problem.

30
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:31,760
The experience of exploring those ideas
that you leave behind will make you

31
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:34,910
a better designer for
the ideas that you do choose to pursue.

32
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:37,950
In all likelihood your ultimate
design will be some combination of

33
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:40,510
the design alternatives
that you explored earlier.

34
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:42,730
So, take my security system for
an example.

35
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:46,950
There are two ways of interacting with
it, the key pad and the key chain.

36
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:49,370
Two different designs that,
in this particular instance,

37
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:51,150
integrated just fine.

38
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:53,760
Different alternatives won't always
integrate side by side this easily,

39
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:57,910
but the design process as a whole is
an iterative process of brainstorming,

40
00:01:57,910 --> 00:02:01,540
combining, abandoning, revising and
improving your ideas, and

41
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:03,960
that requires you start with
several ideas in the first place.
