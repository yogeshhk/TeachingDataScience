00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,900
In this lesson we've covered several
different ways of developing design

2
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:04,290
alternatives.

3
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:06,750
Each method has its advantages and
disadvantages.

4
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:10,870
So, let's start rap the lesson up
by exploring this with an exercise.

5
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:12,830
Here are the methods
that we've covered and

6
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:15,250
here are some other
potential advantages.

7
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:16,379
For each row,

8
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:19,960
mark which of the different
methods possesses that advantage.

9
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:21,500
Note that these might
be somewhat relative,

10
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:24,250
so your answer might differ from
ours and that's perfectly fine.
