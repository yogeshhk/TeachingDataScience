00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:04,380
Here are five quick tips for
effective individual brain storming.

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:07,510
Number one, write down the core problem.

3
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:09,110
Keep this visible.

4
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:11,770
You want to let your mind enter
a divergent thinking mode but

5
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:14,700
you also want to remain
grounded in the problem.

6
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:15,740
Writing down the problem and

7
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:19,686
keeping it available will help you
remain focused while remaining creative.

8
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:21,198
Number two.

9
00:00:21,198 --> 00:00:22,864
Constrain yourself.

10
00:00:22,864 --> 00:00:27,190
Decide you want at least on idea in
a number of different categories.

11
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:30,170
Personally, I try to make sure I
have at least three ideas that use

12
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:33,040
nontraditional interaction methods,
like touch and voice.

13
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,681
You can constrain yourself
in strange ways too.

14
00:00:35,681 --> 00:00:38,530
Force yourself to think of
solutions that are too expensive or

15
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:40,420
not physically possible.

16
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:42,970
The act of thinking in these
directions will help you out later.

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,220
Number three.

18
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:46,107
Aim for 20.

19
00:00:46,107 --> 00:00:49,330
Don't stop until you have twenty ideas.

20
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:52,220
These ideas don't have to be very
well-formed or complex, they can be

21
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:55,850
simply one sentence descriptions
of designs you might pursue.

22
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:57,670
This forces you to think
through the problem,

23
00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:00,010
rather than getting tunnel
vision on an early idea.

24
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:01,982
Number 4.

25
00:01:01,982 --> 00:01:03,213
Take a break.

26
00:01:03,213 --> 00:01:05,967
You don't need to come up with all
of these at once and, in fact,

27
00:01:05,967 --> 00:01:09,450
you'll probably find it's easier
if you leave and come back.

28
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:11,720
I'm not just talking about
a ten minute break either.

29
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:14,750
Stop brainstorming and decide to
continue a couple days later but

30
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:16,980
be ready to write down new
ideas that come to you.

31
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:18,680
Number 5.

32
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:21,240
Divide and conquer.

33
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:24,648
If you're dealing with a problem like
helping kids lead healthier lifestyles,

34
00:01:24,648 --> 00:01:28,700
divide it into smaller problems and
brainstorm solutions to those.

35
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:30,740
If we're designing audio books for
exercises, for

36
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:34,030
example, we might divide it into
things like the ability to take and

37
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:37,350
review notes, or the ability to
control playback hands-free.

38
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:38,560
Divide it like that and

39
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,860
brainstorm solutions to each
individual little problem.
