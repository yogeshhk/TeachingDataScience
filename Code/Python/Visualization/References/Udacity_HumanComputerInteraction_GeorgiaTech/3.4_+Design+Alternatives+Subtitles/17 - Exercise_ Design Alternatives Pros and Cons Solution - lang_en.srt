1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:02,800
So personally here's my answer.

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:05,920
For me scenarios are really the only
ones that include the entire

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:07,550
task context.

4
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:09,390
You can make the case that personas and

5
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:13,160
timelines do as well, but I tend to
think that these are a little bit too

6
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:16,440
separated from the task to
really include the context.

7
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:20,330
Personas and user profiles, on the other
hand, do include the users context.

8
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:23,350
They include plenty of information
about who the user is,

9
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:25,930
why they're doing this task,
and what their motivations are.

10
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:27,810
You could make the argument as well,

11
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:30,885
that scenarios and
timelines include the user's context.

12
00:00:30,885 --> 00:00:33,515
Because the way we describe them,
they're instances

13
00:00:33,515 --> 00:00:37,505
of the personas being stretched
out over a scenario or over time.

14
00:00:37,505 --> 00:00:41,685
User profile probably do the cleanest
job of delineating the target audience.

15
00:00:41,685 --> 00:00:44,425
With our personas we have kind of
a fuzzy idea of who are different

16
00:00:44,425 --> 00:00:45,290
users are.

17
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:48,890
But our user profiles really formally
articulate the space of your users in

18
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:50,160
which we're interested.

19
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,620
As far as general workflows that's
what user modeling is really good at.

20
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:55,750
It really outlines the phases or

21
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:59,080
steps or operators that users
use in a general sense.

22
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:02,000
You could say the same thing about
timelines to a certain extent although

23
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,740
timelines are more focused on what
the user is thinking and feeling and

24
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:08,760
less on their actual workflow
with regard to the task.

25
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:12,030
As far as capturing activity over time,
scenarios, timelines, and

26
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:16,250
user modeling all have an element
of time in what they analyze.

27
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:19,220
And possibly one of the bigger
benefits of using scenarios

28
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:22,180
is they allow us to capture
potential edge cases more easily.

29
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:25,620
Timelines, user models,
user profiles and personas are all about

30
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:29,190
the general user or the general
routine interaction with the task.

31
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:32,970
But scenarios let us pose
interesting and novel situations so

32
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:36,570
that we can kind of mentally simulate
how our different design alternatives

33
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:38,060
will work with that scenario.

34
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:40,580
For example, we wouldn't say that
a fire engine going by Morgan,

35
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:42,860
which is listening to an audiobook,
is a routine thing, so

36
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:46,050
it probably wouldn't come up in our
timeline or in our user modeling.

37
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:49,050
But we can develop a scenario that
explores how is she going to deal with

38
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:50,540
that particular event.

39
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:52,490
And while it might seem
a little silly to focus so

40
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:55,410
much on edge cases,
as we do more and more design,

41
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:58,590
we start to discover that
there are a lot of edge cases.

42
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:00,070
They're all different.

43
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:03,110
But a lot of our time is spent dealing
with those unique circumstances that

44
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:06,470
fall pretty far outside the routine
interaction with the program.
