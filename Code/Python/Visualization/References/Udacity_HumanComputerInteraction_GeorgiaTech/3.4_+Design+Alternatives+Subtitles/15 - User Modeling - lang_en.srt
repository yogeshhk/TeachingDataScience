00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:04,080
In our unit on principles, we talk about
task analysis, including things like

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,590
cognitive task analysis or
human information processor models.

3
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:10,280
Performing those analysis
as part of our need finding

4
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:14,180
also gives us a nice tool for
exploring our design alternatives.

5
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:18,824
Using this, we can start to look at how
exactly the goals, operators, methods,

6
00:00:18,824 --> 00:00:22,729
and selection rules of the Gomes model
map up to the ideas of our design

7
00:00:22,729 --> 00:00:24,080
alternatives.

8
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:27,290
How does the user achieve each of
their goals in each interface?

9
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:30,530
How relatively easy are the goals to
achieve between the different design

10
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:31,660
alternatives?

11
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:34,250
With the results of our cognitive
task analysis, we can start to

12
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:38,780
ask some deeper questions about what
the user is keeping in mind as well.

13
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:42,100
Given what we know about things
competing for our user's attention,

14
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:44,690
what are the likelihoods that
each interface will work?

15
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:48,640
In some ways, this is a similar process
to using personas we outlined earlier,

16
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,400
but with a subtle difference.

17
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:51,770
Personas are personal and

18
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:55,210
meant to give us an empathetic
view of the user experience.

19
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:58,630
User models are more objective and
meant to give us a measurable and

20
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:01,680
comparable view of the user experience.

21
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,069
So ideally, the result of this kind of
analysis is we would be able to say that

22
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:08,090
the different alternatives have these
different phases and these different

23
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:12,140
phases have different efficiencies or
different speeds associated with them.

24
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:15,605
So, we could start to say exactly
how efficient one design is compared

25
00:01:15,605 --> 00:01:16,260
to another.
