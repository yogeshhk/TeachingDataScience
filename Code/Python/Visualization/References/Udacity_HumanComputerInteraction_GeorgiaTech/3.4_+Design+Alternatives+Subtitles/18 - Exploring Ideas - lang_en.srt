1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:02,950
So let's apply these techniques to
some of the ideas that I came up with

2
00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:04,310
earlier.

3
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:05,930
The first thing I might
do is go ahead and

4
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:10,260
rule out any of the ideas that
are just technologically unfeasible.

5
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:13,070
Coming up with those wasn't a waste of
time because they're part of a nice

6
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:15,720
broad free flow brainstorming process.

7
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:17,410
But skin based interfaces and

8
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:22,370
augmented reality, probably are not on
the table for the immediate future.

9
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:24,710
I might also rule out the options
that are unfeasible for

10
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:26,430
some more practical reasons.

11
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:29,250
We might a small team of developers,
for example.

12
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:33,330
So, a dedicated wearable device
isn't really our expertise.

13
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:36,500
Now the one I might do next is create
some timelines, covering a sequence of

14
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:40,090
events in exercising to use to
explore these alternatives further.

15
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:43,101
I might notice that the users
I observed and talked with,

16
00:00:43,101 --> 00:00:45,245
valued efficiency in getting started.

17
00:00:45,245 --> 00:00:49,084
They don't want to have to walk through
a complex set up process every time they

18
00:00:49,084 --> 00:00:50,081
start to exercise.

19
00:00:50,081 --> 00:00:53,839
I might also use my user persona's to
explore the cognitive load of the users

20
00:00:53,839 --> 00:00:56,160
in these different alternatives.

21
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,760
They have a lot going on, between
monitoring their exercise progress,

22
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,160
observing their environment,
and listening to the book.

23
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,530
So, I'm going to want to keep
cognitive load very low.

24
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:07,780
Now granted, we always want to keep
cognitive load pretty low, but

25
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:10,790
in this case, the competing
tasks are significant enough,

26
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:12,490
that I want to sacrifice features for

27
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:16,230
simplicity, if it keeps that
cognitive load pretty manageable.

28
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:19,170
Now based on these timelines and
these personas, I would probably

29
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:22,710
end up here with three design
alternatives that I want to explore.

30
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:25,880
One is a traditional touch interface,
a smartphone app.

31
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:28,575
Then unfortunately it means the user is
going to have to pull out their phone

32
00:01:28,575 --> 00:01:30,415
whenever they want to take a note.

33
00:01:30,415 --> 00:01:33,355
But if I can design it well enough
that might not be an issue.

34
00:01:33,355 --> 00:01:36,335
I also know that approach gets
me a lot of flexibility so

35
00:01:36,335 --> 00:01:38,775
it's good to at least explore it.

36
00:01:38,775 --> 00:01:41,727
A second approach is
gestural interfaces.

37
00:01:41,727 --> 00:01:45,215
I know that people aren't usually
holding their device while exercising.

38
00:01:45,215 --> 00:01:47,817
So it would be great if they had
someway of interacting without pulling

39
00:01:47,817 --> 00:01:49,082
out their phone.

40
00:01:49,082 --> 00:01:50,465
Gestures might let us do that.

41
00:01:50,465 --> 00:01:53,837
Now in our gesture recognition
is in its infancy, but

42
00:01:53,837 --> 00:01:56,047
we might be able delivered
smart watched technology or

43
00:01:56,047 --> 00:01:59,897
something like a Fitbit to
support interaction via gestures.

44
00:01:59,897 --> 00:02:03,717
A third approach is a voice interface,
I know people generally aren't

45
00:02:03,717 --> 00:02:07,390
communicating verbally while exercising,
so why not a voice interface?

46
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:09,740
That can even double as
the note taking interface.

47
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:12,750
So now that I have three
design alternatives that I'm

48
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:16,750
interested in exploring, I would move
on to the prototyping stage which is

49
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:20,130
building some version of these
that I can test with real users.
