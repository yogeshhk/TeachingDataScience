00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,270
Cognition on its own is interested in thought processes and

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:07,050
experiences and we naturally think of those as occurring inside the mind.

3
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:09,120
But distributed cognition suggests that models

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,655
of cognition should be extended outside the mind.

5
00:00:11,655 --> 00:00:15,315
This theory proposes expanding the unit we use to analyze intelligence from

6
00:00:15,315 --> 00:00:17,550
a single mind to a mind equipped with

7
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:20,055
other minds and artifacts and the relationships among them.

8
00:00:20,055 --> 00:00:21,930
So, let's take an example of this.

9
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:24,855
Amanda, give me a hard addition problem.

10
00:00:24,855 --> 00:00:28,995
1,238 plus 6,437.

11
00:00:28,995 --> 00:00:31,770
Okay, can I do that in my head? No, I

12
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:34,020
also can't even remember the numbers you just read to me.

13
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:36,150
But I have a pen and paper here and using those,

14
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:37,320
I can easily write down the numbers,

15
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,030
so give those numbers to me again.

16
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:43,125
1,238 plus 6,437.

17
00:00:43,125 --> 00:00:52,590
Okay. Using that, I can now do the calculations by hand and the answer is 7,675.

18
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:55,800
Now, did I get smarter when I grabbed the pen and paper?

19
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,955
Not really, not by the usual definition of smarter at least.

20
00:00:58,955 --> 00:01:01,220
But the system comprised of myself, the pen,

21
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:03,870
the paper, is a lot more than just my mind on its own.

22
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:06,620
The cognition was distributed amongst these artifacts.

23
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:09,230
Specifically, the paper took care of remembering the numbers for

24
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:12,010
me and remembering and tracking my progress so far.

25
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:16,680
So, instead of adding 1,238 plus 6,437,

26
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,785
I was really just adding eight plus seven,

27
00:01:18,785 --> 00:01:21,500
three plus three, two plus four, and so on.
