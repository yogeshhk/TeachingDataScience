1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:02,980
Something important to note is
that distributed cognition isn't

2
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:05,120
really another design principle.

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:08,990
Distributed cognition is more of
a way of looking at interface design.

4
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:11,840
It's a way of approaching the problem
that puts your attention squarely on how

5
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:14,860
to extend the mind across artifacts.

6
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:17,730
We can actually view many of our
design principles as examples of

7
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:18,680
distributed cognition.

8
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:21,520
So this is my computer,
and when I set this up,

9
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:24,250
I wasn't thinking about it in
terms of distributed cognition.

10
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:27,060
And yet we can use distributive
cognition as a lens through which to

11
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:28,550
view this design.

12
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:31,250
For example, I always have my
calendar open on the right.

13
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:33,900
That's a way of off loading having to
keep track of my daily schedule in

14
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:34,910
working memory.

15
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:38,440
It bugs me if I have a teleconference
to attend or somewhere I need to go.

16
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:40,980
In fact I rely on this so
much it gets me in trouble.

17
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:42,640
It doesn't keep track of
where I need to be for

18
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,740
a given meeting and if I fail to
keep track of that in working memory

19
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:48,520
I might end up at home when I
need to be at Georgia Tech.

20
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:51,680
We can even view trivial things like
a clock as an example of distributed

21
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,390
cognition that prevents me from
having to keep track of the passage

22
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:55,870
of time manually.

23
00:00:55,870 --> 00:00:59,110
The point is that distributed cognition
is a way of looking at interfaces and

24
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:02,780
interface design that focuses your
attention on what systems as a whole can

25
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:05,430
accomplish as opposed to
individuals on their own.
