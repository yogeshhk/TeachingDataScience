1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,950
Activity theory is a massive and
well developed set of theories regarding

2
00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:07,130
interaction between various
pieces of an activity.

3
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:08,310
The theory as a whole is so

4
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:11,700
complex that you could teach
an entire class on it alone.

5
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:12,995
It predates HCI.

6
00:00:12,995 --> 00:00:17,495
And in fact, activity theory is one of
the first places the idea of interacting

7
00:00:17,495 --> 00:00:20,325
through an interface actually came from.

8
00:00:20,325 --> 00:00:23,215
In our conversations about HCI though,
there are three main

9
00:00:23,215 --> 00:00:25,895
contributions of activity theory
that I'd like you to come away with.

10
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:29,020
First, when we discuss
designing tasks and

11
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:33,420
completing tasks through an interface,
we risk missing a key component.

12
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:34,640
Why?

13
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,460
We could jump straight to
designing the task, but

14
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:39,600
why is the user completing
the task in the first place?

15
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,660
That can have significant
implications for our design.

16
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:48,044
Activity theory generalizes our unit of
analysis from the task to the activity.

17
00:00:48,044 --> 00:00:50,426
We're not just interested
in what they're doing, but

18
00:00:50,426 --> 00:00:53,170
why they're doing it and
what it means to them.

19
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:56,375
Our designs will be different, for
example, if users are using a system

20
00:00:56,375 --> 00:00:59,905
because they're required to or
because they choose to.

21
00:00:59,905 --> 00:01:02,285
Notice how this is similar to
our discussion of distributed

22
00:01:02,285 --> 00:01:03,875
cognition, as well.

23
00:01:03,875 --> 00:01:07,535
In distributed cognition, we were
generalizing the unit of analysis

24
00:01:07,535 --> 00:01:10,380
from a person,
to a system of people and artifacts.

25
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:15,860
Here, we're generalizing the unit of
analysis from a task to an activity

26
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:17,800
surrounding a task.

27
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:22,090
In both ways, we're zooming out
on the task and the design space.

28
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:26,470
Second, activity theory puts an emphasis
on the idea that we can create low level

29
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:29,500
operations from higher level actions.

30
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,490
We saw something similar
to this with GOMS models,

31
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:34,190
where methods were made up of operators.

32
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:36,900
This has a special
historical significance.

33
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:41,100
Before activity theory and similar
theories reached HCI in the 1980s,

34
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,410
HCI was largely concerned
with minute things,

35
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:46,970
like how quickly a person can click
a button or type in a command.

36
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:50,470
Activity theory helped us zoom out from
those low level interactions, those low

37
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:55,430
level operators, to general user needs
at the action or the activity levels.

38
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:58,550
And third,
activity theory points out that actions

39
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:02,170
by the user can actually move up and
down this hierarchy.

40
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:04,600
A common example of
this is driving a car.

41
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:07,640
The first time you drove a car,
shifting gears between park and

42
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:11,320
drive was a very conscious
action made up of operators like

43
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:13,818
grabbing the gear shift and moving it
in the right direction and letting go.

44
00:02:13,818 --> 00:02:17,040
You had to think about how to press the
button, which way to push the stick, and

45
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,650
when to release it.

46
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:20,700
However, after driving a few times,

47
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:22,860
shifting gears just
becomes second nature.

48
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:25,200
It becomes more like an operator.

49
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,371
It shifted from being a conscious goal
to an operator in your broader driving

50
00:02:29,371 --> 00:02:30,960
behavior.

51
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:34,700
Notice a similarity here to our
previous discussion on learning curves.

52
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:38,550
How quickly an action moves from being
a conscious action to a subconscious

53
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:43,215
operator is also a function of how good
the learning curve is on that design.

54
00:02:43,215 --> 00:02:46,865
Notice also, this is similar to
the question of invisible interfaces.

55
00:02:46,865 --> 00:02:51,555
A good invisible interface helps users
focus on their actions inside the task,

56
00:02:51,555 --> 00:02:53,795
rather than the operators they
use to interact with the system.
