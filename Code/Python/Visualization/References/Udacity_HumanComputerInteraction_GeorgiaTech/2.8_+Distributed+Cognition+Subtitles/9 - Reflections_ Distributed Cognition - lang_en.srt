1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,460
Distributed cognition is a fun one
to reflect on because we can take it

2
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:05,689
to some pretty silly extremes.

3
00:00:05,689 --> 00:00:08,470
We can go so far as to say that
I don't heat up my dinner.

4
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:11,088
The system compromised of myself and
the microwave heats it up.

5
00:00:11,088 --> 00:00:14,720
And I offload the need to track the time
to cook on to my microwave's timer.

6
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:17,670
And that's a perfectly valid
way of looking at things.

7
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:20,590
But what we're interested in
is places where interfaces

8
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:22,950
don't just make our
lives more convenient.

9
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:25,620
We're interested in places where
they systems comprised of us and

10
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:28,390
interfaces are capable of doing more,

11
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:32,618
specifically because those interfaces
exhibit certain cognitive qualities.

12
00:00:32,618 --> 00:00:35,290
The systems might perceive,
they might remember, they might learn,

13
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:36,940
they might act on our behalf.

14
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:40,030
In some way they're all floating
a cognitive task from us.

15
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:43,110
And as a result, the system
comprised of us and the interface,

16
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:45,470
is capable of doing more.

17
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:48,980
So reflect on that a bit, what is the
place where the system comprised of you

18
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:52,890
and some number of interfaces is
capable of doing more than you alone?

19
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:56,610
Specifically, because of the cognitive
qualities that the interfaces possess.
