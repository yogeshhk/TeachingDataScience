1
00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:07,725
Distributed cognition is a perspective on analyzing systems that helps us

2
00:00:07,725 --> 00:00:11,655
emphasize the cognitive components of interfaces themselves.

3
00:00:11,655 --> 00:00:16,245
It helps us look at things we designed as extensions of the user's own cognition.

4
00:00:16,245 --> 00:00:18,840
We can view anything from notes on a desktop to

5
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:22,530
the entire Internet as an extension of the user's own memory.

6
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:25,260
We can view things like Gmail's automatic email filtering

7
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:28,635
as offloading cognitive tasks from the user.

8
00:00:28,635 --> 00:00:30,810
In looking at things through this lens,

9
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:33,140
we focus on the output not just of people into

10
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:36,700
interfaces but on the combination of people and interfaces together.

11
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:41,465
So, what are they able to do together that neither of them could do individually?

12
00:00:41,465 --> 00:00:42,905
As we close this lesson,

13
00:00:42,905 --> 00:00:45,965
think about this in terms of your chosen areas of HCI.

14
00:00:45,965 --> 00:00:49,730
What are the cognitive components of the areas with which you're dealing?

15
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:52,190
How do augmented reality and wearable devices

16
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:55,300
offload some of the users cognition onto the interface?

17
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:58,580
In educational technology or in HCI for healthcare,

18
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:03,230
what are the tasks being accomplished by the systems comprised of users and interfaces?
