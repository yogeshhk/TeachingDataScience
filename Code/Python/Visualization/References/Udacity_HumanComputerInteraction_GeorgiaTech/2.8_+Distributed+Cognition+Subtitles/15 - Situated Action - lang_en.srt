1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,610
Like distributed cognition, situated action is

2
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:05,820
strongly concerned with the context within which people interact.

3
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:07,500
But unlike distributed cognition,

4
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:10,260
situated action is not interested in the long-term and

5
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:13,305
enduring permanent interactions amongst these things.

6
00:00:13,305 --> 00:00:16,800
That's not to say that the theory denies the existence of long-term memory,

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,495
but just has a different focus.

8
00:00:18,495 --> 00:00:21,480
Situated action focuses on humans as improvisers.

9
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:24,875
It's interested, not in the kinds of problems that people have solved before,

10
00:00:24,875 --> 00:00:28,365
but in the kinds of novel situational problems that arise all the time.

11
00:00:28,365 --> 00:00:32,835
So, for example, this is the first time I'm filming with my daughter on camera.

12
00:00:32,835 --> 00:00:34,300
I don't know how she'll act.

13
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:36,690
I don't have contingency plans about how to react

14
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:39,980
if she acts strangely or if she distracts me from my script.

15
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:42,380
I'm just going to figure this out as I go along.

16
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:45,530
This is the kind of interaction that situated action is interested in,

17
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:47,915
and that's important for us as interface designers.

18
00:00:47,915 --> 00:00:51,365
While we like to think we're in charge of structuring task for our users,

19
00:00:51,365 --> 00:00:55,115
in reality, the tasks that we perform are growing out of this interaction.

20
00:00:55,115 --> 00:00:57,680
We can try our best to guide it in certain directions,

21
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,815
but until we actually get our hands on it,

22
00:00:59,815 --> 00:01:01,200
the task doesn't exist.

23
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:04,205
The task of me filming with my daughter didn't exist until this moment.

24
00:01:04,205 --> 00:01:05,735
Once we've got our hands on it,

25
00:01:05,735 --> 00:01:08,270
the task is what we do and not what we design.

26
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:10,700
So, as users, when we use an interface,

27
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:11,810
when we actually do something,

28
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:13,910
we're defining the task as they go along.

29
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:16,190
So, there are three kinds of ways here.

30
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:21,365
One, we must examine the interfaces we design within the context in which they're used.

31
00:01:21,365 --> 00:01:24,140
Two, we must understand that the task that the users

32
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:28,390
perform grows out of this interaction with our interfaces. We don't define it.

33
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:31,565
Three, we can try to structure it as much as we can,

34
00:01:31,565 --> 00:01:32,960
but until users get started,

35
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,775
the task itself doesn't exist.

36
00:01:34,775 --> 00:01:39,050
Once they get started, they play a significant role in defining the task.
