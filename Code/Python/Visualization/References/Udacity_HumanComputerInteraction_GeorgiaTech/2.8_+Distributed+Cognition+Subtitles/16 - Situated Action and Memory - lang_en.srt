1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:04,510
Situated action gives us a valuable
lens to examine issues of memory.

2
00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:05,990
We mention in our lessons on memory and

3
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:09,310
on design principles that
recognition is easier than recall.

4
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:11,740
People have an easier time
recognizing the right answer, or

5
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:14,720
option when they see it rather
than recalling it from scratch.

6
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:17,860
That's in part because memory is so
context dependent.

7
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:21,940
Recognition provides the necessary
context to identify the right option.

8
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:23,290
Relying on recall,

9
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:26,580
means there's little context to cue
the right answer to the users memory.

10
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:29,180
Now I encountered
an interesting example of

11
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:31,340
the value of situated
action a little while ago.

12
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:33,420
My mother just had surgery.

13
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:35,712
And so I would often go over
to help her out with things.

14
00:00:35,712 --> 00:00:39,750
And everytime I would go over,
she'd have four, five favors to ask me.

15
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:41,790
Inevitably I would forget
a couple of those favors and

16
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:44,710
have to be reminded, but
she would always remember.

17
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:47,590
Why was she so much better able
to remember the favors than me?

18
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:49,530
Does she just have a better memory?

19
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:50,260
She didn't make a list.

20
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:52,080
She didn't write them down or
anything like that.

21
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:56,030
So the distributed cognition perspective
doesn't find an external memory being

22
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:57,850
used or anything like that.

23
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:00,650
My hypothesis from the perspective
of situated action,

24
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:03,510
is that she has the context
behind the tasks.

25
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:05,430
She knows why they need to be done.

26
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:07,390
She knows what will
happen if they aren't.

27
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:10,230
For her,
they're part of a broader narrative.

28
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:12,550
For me, they're items on a list.

29
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:14,350
I have no context for why they're there.

30
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:16,510
Or what would happen if they're undone.

31
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:17,330
For her,

32
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:20,800
they're easy to remember because
they're situated in a larger context.

33
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:23,330
For me, they're difficult
because they're isolated.
