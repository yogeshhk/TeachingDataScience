00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:03,440
Almost any interface on the computer
can be analyzed from the perspective of

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:07,580
distributed cognition but right now,
I'm most interested in my email.

3
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:11,100
My email is an unbelievable extension of
my longterm memory because whenever I

4
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:12,800
see anything in email,

5
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,390
I know I don't actually need to
commit it to my own long-term memory.

6
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:17,040
It's there, it's safe forever and

7
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:19,760
if I ever need to find it again,
I'll be able to find it.

8
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,470
Now, finding it might
take some work sometimes,

9
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:24,450
but rarely as much work as
manually remembering it.

10
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:28,360
For me, I also mark messages as unread
if I'm the one they're waiting on, or

11
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:30,150
if I need to make sure
I come back to them.

12
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:34,360
And so, my email is an external memory
of both all my communications via email,

13
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:36,480
and tasks that are waiting
on me to move forward.
