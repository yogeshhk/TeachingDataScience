00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:04,538
Distributed cognition is deeply
related to the idea of cognitive load.

2
00:00:04,538 --> 00:00:07,280
Recall the cognitive load refers to
your minds ability to only deal with

3
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:09,510
a certain amount of
information at a time.

4
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:12,440
Distributed cognition suggests
that artifacts add additional

5
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:14,040
cognitive resources.

6
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:17,000
That means the same cognitive load
is distributed across a greater

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,590
number of resources.

8
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:22,210
Artifacts are like plugging
extra memory into your brain.

9
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:23,850
Driving is a good example of this.

10
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:27,473
Sometimes while driving, you're
cognitive load can be very, very high.

11
00:00:27,473 --> 00:00:29,920
You have to keep track of
the other cars around you.

12
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:33,110
You have to keep track of your own
speed to monitor your route planning.

13
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:35,360
You have to make predictions
about traffic patterns.

14
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,790
You have to pay attention to your own
level of gasoline, or in my case,

15
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:39,733
electric charge.

16
00:00:39,733 --> 00:00:42,594
You might be attending to something in
your car as well, like talking to your

17
00:00:42,594 --> 00:00:45,320
passenger, or keeping an eye on
your child in the back seat.

18
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:47,050
It can be a big challenge.

19
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:51,744
A GPS is a way of off-loading one of the
tasks, navigation, on to another system.

20
00:00:51,744 --> 00:00:55,980
And thus, your cognition, is now
distributed between you In the GPS.

21
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:59,110
Turn on cruise control and now it's
distributed across the car, as well.

22
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:02,590
Your off loading the task of
tracking your speed to the car.

23
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:04,530
Every task you also de-artifacts,

24
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:06,630
decreases your own
personal cognitive load.
