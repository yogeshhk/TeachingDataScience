00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,941
Think-aloud protocols are similar to
interviews in that we're asking users to

2
00:00:03,941 --> 00:00:05,905
talk about their
perceptions of the task.

3
00:00:05,905 --> 00:00:08,889
But with think-aloud,
we're asking them to actually do so

4
00:00:08,889 --> 00:00:10,242
in the context of the task.

5
00:00:10,242 --> 00:00:13,634
So instead of bringing Morgan in to
answer some questions about listening to

6
00:00:13,634 --> 00:00:16,443
audiobooks while exercising,
I'll ask her to actually think

7
00:00:16,443 --> 00:00:18,995
out loud while listening to
audiobooks and exercising.

8
00:00:18,995 --> 00:00:21,139
If this was a different task
like something on a computer,

9
00:00:21,139 --> 00:00:23,033
I could have her just come
into my lab and work on it.

10
00:00:23,033 --> 00:00:26,238
But since this is out in the world,
what I might just do is give her a voice

11
00:00:26,238 --> 00:00:29,561
recorder to record her thoughts while
she's out running and listening.

12
00:00:29,561 --> 00:00:33,098
Now think aloud is very useful, because
it can help us get at users thoughts

13
00:00:33,098 --> 00:00:35,976
that they forget when they are no
longer engaged in the task.

14
00:00:35,976 --> 00:00:39,796
But it's also a bit dangerous by asking
people to think aloud about their task,

15
00:00:39,796 --> 00:00:42,534
we encourage them to think
about it more deliberately and

16
00:00:42,534 --> 00:00:45,120
that can change the way
they actually act.

17
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,930
So while it's useful to get an
understanding of what they are thinking,

18
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:50,540
we should check to see if there are
places where what they do differs when

19
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:52,080
thinking out loud about it.

20
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:54,260
We can do that with what's
called a post-event protocol,

21
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:57,220
which is largely the same,
except we wait to get the user's

22
00:00:57,220 --> 00:01:00,050
thoughts until immediately
after the activity.

23
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:02,590
That way, the activity is still
fresh in their minds, but

24
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:05,500
the act of thinking about it shouldn't
affect their performance quite as much.
