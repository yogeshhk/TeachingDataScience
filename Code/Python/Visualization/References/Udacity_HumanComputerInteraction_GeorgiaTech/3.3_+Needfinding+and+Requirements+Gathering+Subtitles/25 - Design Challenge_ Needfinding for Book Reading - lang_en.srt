1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:02,029
The needfinding exercises
that we've gone through so

2
00:00:02,029 --> 00:00:05,020
far focus on the needs
of the exercisers.

3
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:06,180
What can they do with their hands,

4
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:09,600
what is the environment around them
like while exercising, and so on?

5
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:12,660
However, that's only half the picture
for this particular design.

6
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:15,620
Our ultimate goal is to bring
the experience of consuming books

7
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:17,340
to people that exercise,

8
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:21,270
which means we also need to understand
the task of book-reading on its own.

9
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:23,850
Now a problem space is
still around exercisers, so

10
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:27,110
we wouldn't go through the entire design
life cycle for book reading on its own.

11
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:29,770
We don't need to design or
prototype anything for them.

12
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:32,390
But if we're going to bring the full
book reading experience to people while

13
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:35,650
exercising, we need to
understand what that is.

14
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:38,340
So take a moment and
design an approach to needfinding for

15
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:39,630
people who are reading on their own.
