1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:04,040
We've noted that design is a life cycle
from needfinding to brainstorming design

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:06,730
alternatives to
prototyping to evaluation.

3
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:09,520
And then, back to needfinding
to continue the cycle again.

4
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:13,180
Needfinding on it's own though
can be a cycle by itself.

5
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:16,640
For example, we might use the results
of our naturalistic observation

6
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,630
to inform the questions we
asked during our interviews.

7
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:22,060
For example, imagine that we
noticed that very many joggers,

8
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:24,040
jog with only one earphone in.

9
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:28,462
That's a naturalistic observation, and
then in an interview, we might ask,

10
00:00:28,462 --> 00:00:31,104
why do some of you jog
with only one earphone in?

11
00:00:31,104 --> 00:00:34,088
And we might get the answer from
the interview that it's to listen for

12
00:00:34,088 --> 00:00:34,860
cars or listen for

13
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:39,010
someone trying to get their attention
because they exercise in a busy area.

14
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:42,970
Now that we understand why they have
that behavior, maybe we develop a survey

15
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:46,460
to try and see how widespread that
behavior is, and ask, how many

16
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:50,430
of you need to worry about what's around
you when you're listening while driving?

17
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:53,100
If we notice in those surveys
a significant split in the number of

18
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:54,830
people who were concerned about that,

19
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:57,560
that might inform our next round
of naturalistic observation.

20
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:00,790
We might go out and look and see in what
environments are people only wearing

21
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:03,900
one headphone and in what
environments are they wearing both.

22
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:08,010
So in that way all of the different
kinds of need finding that we do

23
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:11,490
can inform our next round of
other kinds of need finding.

24
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:14,300
We can go through entire
cycles just of need finding

25
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:18,270
without ever going on to our design
alternatives or prototyping stages.

26
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:19,530
However, the prototyping and

27
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:23,220
evaluation that we do will then
become another input into this.

28
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:26,450
During our evaluation we might
discover things that will then inform

29
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:29,810
what we need to do next as far
as need finding is concerned.

30
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:33,860
Creating prototypes and evaluating
them gives us data on what works and

31
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:34,790
what doesn't.

32
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:37,920
And that might inform what we want to
observe to better understand the task

33
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,530
going forward.

34
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:43,330
That's the reason why the output
of evaluation is more needfinding.

35
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:47,020
It would be a mistake to do one
initial needfinding stage, and

36
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:50,570
then jump in to a back and forth
cycle of prototyping and evaluation.
