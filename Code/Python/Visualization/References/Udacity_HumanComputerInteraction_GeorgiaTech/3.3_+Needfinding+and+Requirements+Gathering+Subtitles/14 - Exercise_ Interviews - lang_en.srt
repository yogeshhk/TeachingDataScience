00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,700
Interviews are likely to be one of
the most common ways you gather data.

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:07,150
So let's run through some good and
bad interview questions real quick.

3
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:08,790
So here are six questions.

4
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:11,520
Which of these would make
good interview questions?

5
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:13,823
Mark the ones that would be good.

6
00:00:13,823 --> 00:00:15,502
For the ones that would be bad,

7
00:00:15,502 --> 00:00:19,191
briefly brainstorm a way to rewrite
the question to make it better.

8
00:00:19,191 --> 00:00:21,791
You can go ahead and skip forward to the
exercise if you don't want to listen to

9
00:00:21,791 --> 00:00:23,240
me read them out.

10
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,320
Number one, do you exercise?

11
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:28,300
Number two, how often do you exercise?

12
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:32,280
Number three, do you exercise for
health or for pleasure?

13
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:36,790
Number four, what, if anything do
you listen to while exercising?

14
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:41,390
Number five, what device do you use to
listen to something while exercising?

15
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:44,060
Number six, we're developing an app for

16
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:46,560
listening to audio
books while exercising.

17
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:47,690
Would that be interesting to you?
