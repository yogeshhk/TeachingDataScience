1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:04,030
Most of the other methods for need
finding, like observation, interviewing,

2
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:06,760
apprenticeship, require
a significant amount of effort for

3
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:08,630
what is often relatively little data.

4
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:11,380
Or it's data from
a small number of users.

5
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:14,620
We might spend an entire hour
interviewing a single possible user or

6
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:18,440
an hour observing a small
number of users in the world.

7
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:21,840
The data we get from those interactions
is deep and thorough, but sometimes,

8
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,860
we also want broader data.

9
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:27,210
Sometimes, we just want to know how many
people encounter a certain difficulty or

10
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:29,030
engage in a certain task.

11
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:31,910
If we're designing an audio book app for
exercisers, for example.

12
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:34,805
Maybe we just want to know how
often those people exercises or

13
00:00:34,805 --> 00:00:38,110
maybe we want to know what
kind of books they listen to.

14
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:42,370
At that point, a survey might be our
more appropriate means of need finding.

15
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:45,640
Surveys let us get a much larger
number of responses very quickly and

16
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:47,390
the questions can be
phrased objectively,

17
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:49,550
allowing for quicker interpretation.

18
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:52,490
And plus, with the Internet, they can
be administered asynchronously for

19
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:54,270
at a pretty low cost.

20
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:56,660
A few weeks ago, for example,
I came up with the idea for

21
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:57,800
a study on Friday morning.

22
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:01,620
And with the great cooperation from our
local IRB office, I was able to send out

23
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:05,370
the survey to potential participants
less than 24 hours later and

24
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:08,030
receive 150 responses within a week.

25
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:11,290
Now of course, the data I receive from
that isn't nearly as thorough as what I

26
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:13,810
would receive from interviewing
some of those participants.

27
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:16,770
But it's a powerful way of
getting a larger amount of data.

28
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:19,890
And it can be especially useful to
decide what to ask participants

29
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:21,980
during interviews or
during focus groups.
