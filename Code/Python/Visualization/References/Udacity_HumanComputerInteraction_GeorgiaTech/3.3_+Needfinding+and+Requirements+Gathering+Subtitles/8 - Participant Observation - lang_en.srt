1
00:00:00,082 --> 00:00:03,080
Sometimes it's not just enough to
watch people engaging in a task.

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:06,265
Sometimes we want to experience
a task for ourselves.

3
00:00:06,265 --> 00:00:07,740
So that's what I'm going to do.

4
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:09,510
I listen to audiobooks a lot.

5
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:10,730
I don't really exercise.

6
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:12,057
I should, but I don't.

7
00:00:12,057 --> 00:00:13,120
But I'm going to try this out.

8
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:15,560
So I've got my audiobook queued up,
I've got my mic on so

9
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:17,070
I can take notes as I run.

10
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:19,072
So I'm going to go on a jog and
see what I discover.

11
00:00:25,446 --> 00:00:27,070
So what did I learn?

12
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:28,750
I learned that I'm out of shape for
one thing.

13
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:31,090
I already knew that but
I learned it again.

14
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:33,160
I also learned that this app
would be very useful for

15
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:36,090
anyone doing participant
observation on exercisers.

16
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:38,180
Because I kept having to stop
to record notes for myself,

17
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:41,420
which I could have done with this
app that I'm trying to implement.

18
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:44,347
But aside from that, I noticed that
unexpected things happen pretty often

19
00:00:44,347 --> 00:00:46,495
that made me wish that I could
easily go back in my book.

20
00:00:46,495 --> 00:00:49,113
Or sometimes there are just things
I just wanted to hear again, but

21
00:00:49,113 --> 00:00:50,387
there was no easy way to do that.

22
00:00:50,387 --> 00:00:52,800
I also notice that there's
definitely the need there for me.

23
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,990
I already planned to listen to
everything again now that I'm home

24
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:59,430
because there were notes I wanted to
take that I couldn't take easily.

25
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:02,368
I also noticed that while
sometimes I wanted to take notes,

26
00:01:02,368 --> 00:01:04,700
sometimes I also just
want to leave a bookmark.

27
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:06,520
Now we do have to be
careful here though.

28
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:08,980
Remember you are not your user.

29
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:12,390
When you're working as a participant
observer, you can avail useful insights,

30
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:15,440
but you shouldn't over
represent your own experiences.

31
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:18,650
You should use this experience as
a participant observer to inform what

32
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:19,910
you ask users going forward
