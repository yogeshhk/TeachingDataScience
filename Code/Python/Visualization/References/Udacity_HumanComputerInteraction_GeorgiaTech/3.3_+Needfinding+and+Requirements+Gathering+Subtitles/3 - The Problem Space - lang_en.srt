1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:02,560
In order to do some real need finding,

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:05,810
the first thing we need to do
is identify the problem space.

3
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:07,300
Where is the task occurring,

4
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:12,120
what else is going on, what are the
user's explicit and implicit needs?

5
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:15,060
We'll talk about some of the methods for
doing that in this lesson, but

6
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:16,400
before we get into those methods,

7
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,630
we want to understand the scope
of the space we're looking at.

8
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:22,731
So consider the difference
between these two actions.

9
00:00:22,731 --> 00:00:32,731
[MUSIC]

10
00:00:44,218 --> 00:00:48,600
Notice that in each of these, I'm doing
the same task, turning off the alarm.

11
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:51,620
But in the first scene we're focusing
very narrowly on the interaction between

12
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:53,450
the user and the interface.

13
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:54,440
In the latter,

14
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:58,150
we're taking into consideration
a broader view of the problem space.

15
00:00:58,150 --> 00:00:59,890
We could zoom out even
further if we wanted to and

16
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:04,180
ask questions about Where and why people
need alarm systems in the first place.

17
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:06,640
That might lead us to designing
things like security systems for

18
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,220
dorm rooms or checking systems for
office buildings.

19
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:11,950
As we're going about need finding,

20
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:14,410
we want to make sure we're
taking the broad approach.

21
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:17,610
Understanding the entire problem
space in which we're interested,

22
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:22,170
not just focusing narrowly on the user's
interaction with a particular interface.

23
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:24,630
So in our exploration of methods for
need finding,

24
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:28,050
we're going to start with the most
authentic types of general observation,

25
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:30,767
then move through progressively more
targeted types of need finding.
