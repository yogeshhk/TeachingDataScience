00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,100
When we're trying to make iterative improvements,

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:04,380
one of the best places we can look is at the errors

3
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:07,020
users make with the tools that they currently have available.

4
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:08,715
We can fix those errors,

5
00:00:08,715 --> 00:00:12,540
but we can also use those errors to understand a bit more about the user's mental model.

6
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:15,600
So, here's a common example of an error for me, which is slip.

7
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:18,210
I keep my email open in the window on the left.

8
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:19,530
I frequently forget that it's

9
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:22,425
my active window while I'm trying to type into one of the other windows,

10
00:00:22,425 --> 00:00:25,785
and as a result, I'll hit a bunch of hotkeys in my email interface.

11
00:00:25,785 --> 00:00:28,230
I'll tag random emails, delete random emails.

12
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:29,610
It's just kind of a mess.

13
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:33,210
Now, this is a slip because there's nothing wrong with my mental model of how this works.

14
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:35,505
I understand there's an active window and it's not selected.

15
00:00:35,505 --> 00:00:39,550
The problem is that I can easily forget which window is active.

16
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:42,620
Mistakes, on the other hand, are places where my mental model is weak,

17
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:45,455
and for me, a place where that happens is when I'm using my Mac.

18
00:00:45,455 --> 00:00:49,670
I'm used to PC where the maximize button always makes a window take up the entire screen.

19
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:53,140
I've honestly never fully understood the maximize button on a Mac.

20
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:55,530
Sometimes, it seems to work like a PC maximize button.

21
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:57,360
Sometimes, it just expands the window a bit,

22
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,800
but not to the entire screen.

23
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:03,170
Sometimes, it enters even like a full-screen mode hiding the top taskbar.

24
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:07,010
I make mistakes there because I don't have a strong mental model of how it works.

25
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:08,540
So, if you are watching me,

26
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:11,830
you could see me making these errors and you could ask me why I'm making them.

27
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:14,200
Why did I choose to do that if that was my goal?

28
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:17,450
That works for both discovering hacks and discovering errors.

29
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:20,060
Watch people performing their tasks and ask

30
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:22,840
them about why certain things happened the way that they do.

31
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,890
Discovering hacks and errors involves

32
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:28,250
a little bit more user interaction than just watching people out in the wild.

33
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:30,410
So, how about we do that if we're doing something

34
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:33,110
like creating an app that people are going to use in public?

35
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:35,880
Well, maybe we actually go up to people we see exercising out in public.

36
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,310
We can actually get approval to do that,

37
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:39,170
but that's going to be a little bit awkward and

38
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:41,090
the data we get might not always be great.

39
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:43,070
So, at this point, we might be better off

40
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:46,015
recruiting people to come in and describe their experiences.

41
00:01:46,015 --> 00:01:48,615
People experience hacks and errors pretty consciously.

42
00:01:48,615 --> 00:01:50,480
So, our best bet would likely be to target

43
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:53,540
local exercise groups or local areas where exercisers frequent,

44
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:56,095
and recruit people to come in for a short study.

45
00:01:56,095 --> 00:01:58,100
Or maybe, we could recruit people to

46
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:00,680
participate in a study during their normal exercise routine,

47
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:04,630
taking notes on their experience or talking us through their thought process.

48
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:07,460
We can actually take that to an extreme and actually adapt something like

49
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:11,480
an apprenticeship approach where we actually train to become users.
