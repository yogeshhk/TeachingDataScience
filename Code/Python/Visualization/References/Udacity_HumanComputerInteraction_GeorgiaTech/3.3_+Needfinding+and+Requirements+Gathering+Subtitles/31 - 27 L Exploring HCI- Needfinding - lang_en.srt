1
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:07,180
How might you need finding work in your chosen area of HCI?

2
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:08,700
If you're looking at designing for

3
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:12,314
some technological innovation like augmented or virtual interactions,

4
00:00:12,314 --> 00:00:14,580
the initial phase might not actually be that different.

5
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:19,310
Your goal is to understand how people perform tasks right now without your interface.

6
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:23,195
So, initially, you want to observe them in their naturalistic environment.

7
00:00:23,195 --> 00:00:25,430
Later though you'll need to start thinking about bringing

8
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:28,399
participants to you to experience the devices firsthand.

9
00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:32,090
If you're interested in something like HCI for healthcare or education,

10
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:35,055
you have a wealth of naturalistic observations available to you.

11
00:00:35,055 --> 00:00:38,135
You might even have existing interfaces doing what you want to do

12
00:00:38,135 --> 00:00:41,780
and you can try to leverage those as part of your need-finding exercises.

13
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:44,555
Remember, no matter your area of application,

14
00:00:44,555 --> 00:00:48,730
you want to start with real users that might be observing them in the wild,

15
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:50,065
talking to them directly,

16
00:00:50,065 --> 00:00:52,520
or looking at data they've already generated.
