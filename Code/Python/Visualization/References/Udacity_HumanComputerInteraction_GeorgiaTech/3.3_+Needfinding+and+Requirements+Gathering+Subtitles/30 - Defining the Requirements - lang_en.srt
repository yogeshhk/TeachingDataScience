1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:04,470
Finally, the final step for need-finding
is to define our requirements.

2
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:06,689
These are the requirements that
our final interface must meet.

3
00:00:06,689 --> 00:00:09,240
They should be specific and evaluatable,

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:12,420
and they can include some components
that are outside of users tasks,

5
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:15,670
as well,
as defined by the project requirements.

6
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:19,170
In terms of user tasks, we might have
requirements for guarding functionality,

7
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:22,990
what the interface can actually do,
usability, how certain user interactions

8
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:27,890
must work, learnability, how fast the
user can start to use the interface, and

9
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:29,950
accessibility, who can
use the interface.

10
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:33,680
We might also have some that
are generated by external project

11
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:37,510
requirements, like compatibility,
what devices the interface can run on,

12
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:40,990
compliance, how the interface
protects user privacy, cost,

13
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:44,340
how much the final tool can
actually cost, and so on.

14
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:47,520
We'll use these to evaluate the
interfaces we develop, going forward.
