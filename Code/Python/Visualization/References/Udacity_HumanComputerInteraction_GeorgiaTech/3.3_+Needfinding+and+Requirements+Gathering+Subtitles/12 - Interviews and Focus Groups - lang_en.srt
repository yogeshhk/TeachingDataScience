1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:03,730
A most targeted way of gather
information from users though is just to

2
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:04,960
talk to them.

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:07,440
One way of doing that might be to
bring them in for an interview.

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,310
So I'm sitting here with Morgan,
who's one of the potential users for

5
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:12,700
our audio book app
targeted at exercisers.

6
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:16,090
And we're especially interested in
the kinds of task you perform while

7
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:18,470
exercising and listening to
audio books at the same time.

8
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:18,990
So to start,

9
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:22,380
what kind of challenges do you run
into doing these two things at once?

10
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:25,242
>> I think the biggest challenge
is that it's hard to control it.

11
00:00:25,242 --> 00:00:29,020
I have headphones that have a button
on them that can pause it and play.

12
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:32,670
But if I want to do anything else I
have to stop, pull up my phone and

13
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:34,330
unlock it just to rewind.

14
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:36,430
>> Yeah, that makes sense.

15
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:37,420
Thank you.

16
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:40,110
Interviews are useful ways to get at
with the user is thinking when they're

17
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:41,550
engaging in a task.

18
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:43,290
You can do interviews
one on one like this or

19
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:47,070
you can even do interviews in a group
with multiple users at the same time.

20
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:49,420
Those tend to take on
the form of focus groups,

21
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:52,790
where a number of people are all
talking together about some topic, and

22
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:55,950
you can use them to tease out
different kinds of information.

23
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:58,370
Focus groups can elicit some information
we don't get from this kind of

24
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:02,360
an interview, but they also present
the risk of overly convergent thinking.

25
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:05,590
People tend to kind of agree with other
instead of bringing in new ideas.

26
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:07,910
So they should really be used
in conjunction with interviews,

27
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:09,960
as well as other need
finding techniques.
