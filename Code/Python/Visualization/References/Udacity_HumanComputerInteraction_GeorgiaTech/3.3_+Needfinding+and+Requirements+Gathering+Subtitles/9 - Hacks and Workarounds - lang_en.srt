1
00:00:00,196 --> 00:00:03,088
Let's zoom in a little bit more
on what the user actually does or

2
00:00:03,088 --> 00:00:06,751
we can do naturalistic and participant
observation without having to directly

3
00:00:06,751 --> 00:00:08,189
interact much with our users.

4
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:11,234
We need to get inside users heads
a little more to understand what they're

5
00:00:11,234 --> 00:00:12,128
thinking and doing.

6
00:00:12,128 --> 00:00:15,788
If you're trying to design interfaces
to make existing tasks easier,

7
00:00:15,788 --> 00:00:19,699
one way to research that is to look at
the hacks that users presently employ.

8
00:00:19,699 --> 00:00:23,119
How do they use interfaces in
non-intended ways to accomplish tasks or

9
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:26,596
how do they break out of the interface
to accomplish a task that could have

10
00:00:26,596 --> 00:00:28,479
been accomplished with an interface?

11
00:00:28,479 --> 00:00:31,538
If you're designing a task meant to
be performed at a desk like this,

12
00:00:31,538 --> 00:00:34,996
looking at the person's workspace can
be a great way of accomplishing this.

13
00:00:34,996 --> 00:00:37,853
So for example,
I have six monitors around.

14
00:00:37,853 --> 00:00:40,504
And yet, you still see
Post-It notes on my computer.

15
00:00:40,504 --> 00:00:43,007
How could I possibly need
more screen real estate?

16
00:00:43,007 --> 00:00:45,205
Well, Post-It notes can't be covered up.

17
00:00:45,205 --> 00:00:47,834
They don't take away from
the existing screen real estate.

18
00:00:47,834 --> 00:00:50,518
They're visible even
when the computer is off.

19
00:00:50,518 --> 00:00:54,084
So, this implicit notes here is the way
to hack around the limitations of

20
00:00:54,084 --> 00:00:55,376
the computer interface.

21
00:00:55,376 --> 00:00:58,039
Now when you're looking at hacks,
it's important to not just look at what

22
00:00:58,039 --> 00:01:00,430
the user does and
assume you understand why.

23
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:03,330
Look at their work around and
ask them why they're using them.

24
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:06,380
Find out why they don't just use
the interface that's currently in place.

25
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:07,830
You might find they just
don't know about them,

26
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:10,740
which presents a different
kind of design challenge.

27
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:13,600
Now hacks are related to another method
we can use to uncover user needs as

28
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,380
well, which are called errors.

29
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:19,130
Whereas hacks are ways users get around
the interface to accomplish their tasks,

30
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:22,000
errors are slips or
mistakes that users frequently make

31
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,130
while performing the task
within the interface.
