1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,230
Likely the most significant subfield of HCI is user interface design.

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:07,050
Colloquially, user interface design most often

3
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:09,790
refers to design between a user and some rectangular screen,

4
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:11,675
be it a traditional computer,

5
00:00:11,675 --> 00:00:12,750
a tablet, a laptop,

6
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:14,380
a smartphone, and so on.

7
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:16,740
For a long time, user interface design in

8
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:19,140
HCI were actually pretty much synonymous because

9
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:21,150
the vast majority of interaction between users and

10
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:24,150
computers happened to via a rectangular onscreen interface,

11
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:25,620
connected to a mouse and keyboard.

12
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:27,630
It's relatively recent that we've started to see

13
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:30,240
interaction break out of that literal box,

14
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,310
and to a certain extent, the term UI design,

15
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:33,390
a user interface design,

16
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:34,865
captures this as well.

17
00:00:34,865 --> 00:00:37,310
Interfaces don't have to be screens.

18
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:40,790
Colloquially though, I find most classes on user interface design,

19
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:43,400
focus on designing screens and interacting with screens.

20
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,620
That's a massive and well-developed field.

21
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:50,320
In fact, a lot of this course's material comes from the user interface design space.

22
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,340
There are also some more narrow things that

23
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:54,770
user interface design is concerned with though.

24
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:57,830
UI design has its own set of design principles that apply more

25
00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:01,580
narrowly to the design of traditional computer software or Web sites.

26
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:04,890
Some of these principles guide how people visually group things together,

27
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:07,590
and these are called Gestalt grouping principles.

28
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:09,090
When things are close together,

29
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:10,440
we mentally put them into groups.

30
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:12,000
You'll likely see two groups of three,

31
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,240
and one group of six.

32
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,630
When there are implicit lines,

33
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:15,860
we see a continuation.

34
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:17,195
You'll likely see this as a cube,

35
00:01:17,195 --> 00:01:18,605
even though the lines are broken.

36
00:01:18,605 --> 00:01:20,960
We also group things together based on similarity.

37
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,585
You probably see this as four blue squares,

38
00:01:23,585 --> 00:01:26,395
two gray diamonds, and three orange circles.

39
00:01:26,395 --> 00:01:30,080
While right now you see this as a three by three grid of green circles,

40
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:32,580
watch what happens when they move.

41
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,525
Even after they stopped moving,

42
00:01:35,525 --> 00:01:39,335
you likely still see the diamond that was formed by those moving circles.

43
00:01:39,335 --> 00:01:41,450
These Gestalt principles in some ways,

44
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:45,260
applied a user-interface designs emphasis on designing with good grids in mind.

45
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:48,200
Just the way magazines and newspapers have done for centuries.

46
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,880
We've already discussed this example a lot,

47
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:54,110
and part of it is because this new interface leverages the analogy to the old interface.

48
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:56,555
But its value isn't just in the analogy,

49
00:01:56,555 --> 00:01:59,150
its value is also in the way it instantiates

50
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:02,545
the same Gestalt principles that guided the layout of a newspaper.

51
00:02:02,545 --> 00:02:07,475
Finally, user interface design touches on one of my favorite topics, typography.

52
00:02:07,475 --> 00:02:10,775
Typography is often covered in user interface design courses.

53
00:02:10,775 --> 00:02:14,600
So generally speaking, while in HCI we've taken special care to talk about

54
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:18,860
general methods that deal with any kind of computer interface between users and tasks,

55
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:23,929
user interface design zooms more closely in on the design of interfaces on screens.

56
00:02:23,929 --> 00:02:26,150
If you want to study user-interface design some more,

57
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:29,630
we'll add some links to related courses and materials online to the notes below.
