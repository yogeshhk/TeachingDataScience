1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,020
Human-computer interaction was concerned with the interaction between users

2
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:07,965
and tasks as mediated by things with computing power.

3
00:00:07,965 --> 00:00:10,410
Nowadays, that's more and more common,

4
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:12,810
it's a relatively recent phenomenon that things like

5
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:16,485
watches and cameras were examples of computers.

6
00:00:16,485 --> 00:00:20,250
Where a device doesn't have computational power behind it though,

7
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:22,725
there are still lots of design considerations to make.

8
00:00:22,725 --> 00:00:25,560
In fact, many of our principals and many of our methods

9
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:28,905
apply just as well to non computational interfaces.

10
00:00:28,905 --> 00:00:32,010
What makes human factors engineering particularly interesting,

11
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:35,339
is that it deals with more constraints, physical constraints.

12
00:00:35,339 --> 00:00:37,440
Things like the height of the user or the size of

13
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,575
a hand come up in human factors engineering.

14
00:00:40,575 --> 00:00:43,190
What's interesting though is that as many devices

15
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:45,775
start to have computational resources added to them,

16
00:00:45,775 --> 00:00:47,420
human factors engineering and

17
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:50,690
human-computer interactions start to interact more and more.

18
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:53,840
My watch for example has no computational resources to it,

19
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,150
it's completely within the human factors area,

20
00:00:56,150 --> 00:01:01,085
but smartwatches see some interesting interactions between human factors and HCI.

21
00:01:01,085 --> 00:01:03,860
Human factors determines the size of the watch,

22
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:07,550
which determines the size of the battery or the sensors that can be placed inside.

23
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:11,410
Those things then influence what we can do from the HCI perspective.

24
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:14,825
So, if you're dealing with anything related to ubiquitous computing,

25
00:01:14,825 --> 00:01:17,090
wearable devices, contextual computing,

26
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:20,030
human factors engineering is a great place to start.

27
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:23,270
So, we'll throw you some resources in the notes below.
