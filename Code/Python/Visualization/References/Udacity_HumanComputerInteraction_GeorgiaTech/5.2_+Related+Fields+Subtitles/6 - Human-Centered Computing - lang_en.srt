00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,365
HCI research broadens to a field called human-centered computing.

2
00:00:04,365 --> 00:00:06,450
While much of HCI research is concerned with

3
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:09,510
the immediate interactions between people and computers,

4
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:12,270
human-centered computing is interested more generally in

5
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:16,350
how computers and humans affect each other at the societal level.

6
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:19,440
There's a lot of really fascinating research going on in this area.

7
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:21,870
Some of the questions people are addressing are,

8
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:22,950
how did participants in

9
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:26,820
the Arab Spring use tools like Facebook and Twitter to coordinate?

10
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:29,760
How can information visualizations be employed to help

11
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,200
people better understand their diet and their energy usage?

12
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,685
How does access to computing resources influence early childhood education?

13
00:00:37,685 --> 00:00:40,070
Now, notice that these issues don't necessarily

14
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:42,950
involve designing new interfaces or creating new tools.

15
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:46,865
They involve looking at the way people interact with computers more generally,

16
00:00:46,865 --> 00:00:48,815
and not just specific tools,

17
00:00:48,815 --> 00:00:51,175
but the ubiquity of technology as a whole.

18
00:00:51,175 --> 00:00:52,810
So, if you find this interesting,

19
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:55,010
we'll put some more materials in the notes below.
