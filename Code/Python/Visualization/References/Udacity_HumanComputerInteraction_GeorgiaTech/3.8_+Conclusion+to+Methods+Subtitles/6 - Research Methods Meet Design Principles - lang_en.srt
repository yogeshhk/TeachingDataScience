1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,150
The design principles we describe in our other unit are deeply

2
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:06,285
integrated throughout the design life cycle. They don't supplant it.

3
00:00:06,285 --> 00:00:09,540
You won't be making any great designs just by applying those principles,

4
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:11,160
but they streamline things.

5
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:14,400
In many ways, design principles capture the takeaways and

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,460
the conclusions found by this design life cycle in the past,

7
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:20,745
in ways that can be transferred to new tasks and new interfaces.

8
00:00:20,745 --> 00:00:23,340
In uncovering needs, many of our needs are

9
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:25,965
driven by current understanding of user abilities.

10
00:00:25,965 --> 00:00:28,500
Task analysis allows us to describe those needs,

11
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:32,430
those tasks in formal ways to equip the interface design process,

12
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:36,710
and cognitive load lets us keep in mind how much users are asked to do at a time.

13
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:39,530
Direct manipulation gives us a family of techniques that we

14
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:42,575
want to emphasize in coming up with our design alternatives.

15
00:00:42,575 --> 00:00:45,350
Mental models provide us an understanding of how

16
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:49,165
the design alternatives might mesh with the user's understanding of the task.

17
00:00:49,165 --> 00:00:51,860
Distributed cognition gives us a view on

18
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:56,170
interface design that lends itself to design at a larger level of granularity.

19
00:00:56,170 --> 00:00:58,939
Here we're designing systems not just interfaces.

20
00:00:58,939 --> 00:01:01,730
Design principles in general give us some great rules of

21
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:04,895
thumb to use when creating our initial prototypes and designs.

22
00:01:04,895 --> 00:01:08,240
Our understanding of representations ensures that the prototypes we

23
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,945
create match with users mental models that we uncovered before.

24
00:01:11,945 --> 00:01:14,480
Visible interfaces help us remember that

25
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:17,480
the interface should be the conduit between the user and the task,

26
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:19,480
not the focus of attention itself.

27
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,660
Then the vocabulary of feedback cycles,

28
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:24,350
the gulf of execution and evaluation give us ways to

29
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:28,270
evaluate and describe our evaluations of the interfaces that we design.

30
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:31,880
The notion of politics and values in interfaces allow us

31
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:35,390
to evaluate the interface not just in terms of it's usable interactions,

32
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:38,470
but in the types of society it creates or preserves.

33
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:43,100
Those usability heuristics that we apply to our prototyping are also a way of evaluating

34
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:45,200
our interface and mentally simulating what

35
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,705
a user will be thinking while using our creations.

36
00:01:47,705 --> 00:01:50,030
These principles of HCI were all

37
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:52,760
found through many years of going through the design lifecycle,

38
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:56,605
creating different interfaces, and exploring and evaluating their impact.

39
00:01:56,605 --> 00:01:58,435
By leveraging those lessons,

40
00:01:58,435 --> 00:02:01,760
we can speed to usable interfaces much faster.

41
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:06,640
But applying those lessons doesn't remove the need to go talk to real users.
