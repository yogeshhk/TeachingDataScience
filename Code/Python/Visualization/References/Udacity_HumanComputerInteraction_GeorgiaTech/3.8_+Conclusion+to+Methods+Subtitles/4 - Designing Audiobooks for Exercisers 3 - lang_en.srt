1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,210
At the end of the last iteration through the design cycle,

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:04,995
we had two interface prototypes,

3
00:00:04,995 --> 00:00:07,005
each with significant weaknesses.

4
00:00:07,005 --> 00:00:09,730
Our voice command interface struggled in loud areas,

5
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:11,875
where exercisers are often exercising.

6
00:00:11,875 --> 00:00:15,825
Our screen-based interface presented too high a gulf of execution.

7
00:00:15,825 --> 00:00:18,800
But notice how far we've come at this point.

8
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:24,100
We now have a pretty complete and nuanced view of the task and our possible solutions.

9
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:26,210
So, now let's go through one more iteration to get

10
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:28,745
something we can actually implement and deploy.

11
00:00:28,745 --> 00:00:31,460
Our needfinding has come along with the point of understanding

12
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:34,160
the completely hands-free interfaces are more usable,

13
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,650
but we also know that gesture-based interaction is

14
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:39,350
still technologically not totally feasible,

15
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:41,650
and voice space isn't perfectly reliable.

16
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:45,075
So, now we might come up with a new alternative, a hybrid system.

17
00:00:45,075 --> 00:00:47,555
The voice interaction and on-screen touch interaction

18
00:00:47,555 --> 00:00:50,120
aren't incompatible with one another.

19
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:53,300
So, our new alternative is to develop a system that supports both,

20
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:56,150
allowing users to use voice commands most of the time and

21
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:59,645
default to touch commands in situations where the voice commands won't work.

22
00:00:59,645 --> 00:01:02,360
So, they always have full functionality,

23
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:04,510
but usability is still maximized.

24
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:06,380
So, we create a new prototype,

25
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:09,635
basically merging our two prototypes from the previous iteration.

26
00:01:09,635 --> 00:01:11,630
There is still pretty low fidelity because we

27
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:13,880
haven't tested this particular combination yet,

28
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:17,660
and the next stages of sophistication is going to be pretty expensive to develop.

29
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:20,365
So, we want to make sure that it's worth pursuing.

30
00:01:20,365 --> 00:01:22,300
Then, we evaluate that,

31
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:26,700
and we find it's good enough to go ahead and move forward with producing it.
