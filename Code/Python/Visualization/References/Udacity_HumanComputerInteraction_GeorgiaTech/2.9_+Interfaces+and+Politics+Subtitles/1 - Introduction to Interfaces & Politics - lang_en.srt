00:00:05,285 --> 00:00:10,155
In 1980, Langdon Winner published
a highly influential essay in which he

3
00:00:10,155 --> 00:00:12,800
ask, do artifacts have politics?

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:16,140
In other words, do technical
devices have political qualities?

5
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:17,830
And the answer is yes.

6
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:19,430
All toasters are democrats.

7
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:22,220
Thermostats, as you might expect,
are members of labor party.

8
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:26,140
And pretty surprisingly automobiles
are actually green party members.

9
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:27,000
Okay, I'm kidding.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,980
That's not what we mean when we
ask if artifacts have politics.

11
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:34,110
Here, when we say politics we mean
whether artifacts can personify specific

12
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:37,046
forms of authority or power,
whether for good or bad.

13
00:00:37,046 --> 00:00:40,926
What we're referring to is the fact
that artifacts are interfaces we design,

14
00:00:40,926 --> 00:00:45,650
change the world around us, just the way
politicians or business interests do.

15
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:48,870
Sometimes that's by design, we might
design interfaces not for usability,

16
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:52,230
or research, but
to create change in the world.

17
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:55,850
Other times that social change happens
in ways we didn't anticipate, we design

18
00:00:55,850 --> 00:01:00,020
interfaces that are used and affect
the world in ways we never anticipated.

19
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:03,480
So in this lesson, we're going to
talk about two dimensions of this,

20
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:08,220
designing for change and anticipating
the change from our designs.

21
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:10,980
We'll also touch on a field that
explores these issues more deeply

22
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:12,390
called Value-Sensitive Design.
