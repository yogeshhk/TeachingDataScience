1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:02,260
Let's start with the bad news.

2
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:06,420
The ability of interfaces to
change behavior can be abused.

3
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:09,290
We're not just talking about places
where people put explicit barriers

4
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:12,770
up like blocking certain people
from accessing their content.

5
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:15,970
There are instances where people
create seemingly normal designs with

6
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:18,400
underlying political motivations.

7
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:22,800
Winner describes one such instance in
his essay Do Artifacts Have Politics?

8
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,290
Robert Moses was an influential city
planner working in New York City,

9
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:27,840
in the early 1900s.

10
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:28,740
As part of his role,

11
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:32,590
he oversaw the construction of many
beautiful parks on Long Island.

12
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:35,120
He also oversaw
the construction of parkways,

13
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,590
roads to bring the people
of New York to these parks.

14
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:39,920
That's actually where
the word parkway comes from.

15
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,060
But something unfortunate happened.

16
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:46,300
The bridges along these parkways were
too low for buses to pass under them.

17
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:51,600
As a result, public transportation
couldn't really run easily to his parks.

18
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,075
And as a result of that,

19
00:00:53,075 --> 00:00:56,885
only people wealthy enough to own
cars were able to visit his parks.

20
00:00:56,885 --> 00:00:58,815
What an unfortunate coincidence, right?

21
00:00:58,815 --> 00:01:01,855
The evidence shows it's anything but
coincidence.

22
00:01:01,855 --> 00:01:05,765
Moses intentionally constructed
those bridges to be too low for

23
00:01:05,765 --> 00:01:07,140
buses to pass under.

24
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:11,000
As a way of keeping poor people
from visiting his parks.

25
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,740
His political motivations
directly informed the design of

26
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,100
the infrastructure and

27
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:18,920
the design of the infrastructure
had profound social implications.

28
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:22,970
This is an example of winners
technology as a form of social order.

29
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:24,760
The bridges could have been taller.

30
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:27,670
There's nothing inherently
political about those bridges.

31
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:32,080
It was the way that they were used that
accomplished this political motivation.

32
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:35,040
As an interesting aside, I learned
recently that the design of Central Park

33
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,070
inside New York City was an example
of the exact opposite dynamic.

34
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:42,750
The designers were encouraged to put in
places where only carriages could access

35
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:46,330
so affluent people would have
somewhere to go away from poor people.

36
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:50,670
But the designers specifically made
the entire park accessible to everyone.

37
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:54,750
It's not to hard to imagine things kind
of like that happening today either.

38
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:58,150
One of the arguments from proponents
of Net neutrality is that without it,

39
00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:01,230
companies can set up fast lanes that
prioritize their own content or

40
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:04,650
worse severely diminished
content of their competitors or

41
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:05,810
content critical of the company.
