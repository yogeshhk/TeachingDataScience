1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,510
In HCI, we describe the idea of
interfaces becoming invisible.

2
00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:08,300
Some of that is a useability principle,
but it also applies more broadly

3
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:12,060
to the way that interfaces integrate
themselves into our everyday lives.

4
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:15,580
And if our interfaces are going
to integrate into people's lives,

5
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:19,430
then they need to share the same
values as those individuals as well.

6
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:22,787
This connects to the field
of value sensitive design.

7
00:00:22,787 --> 00:00:27,373
The Value Sensitive Design Lab at the
University of Washington defines this

8
00:00:27,373 --> 00:00:31,456
idea by saying, value sensitive
design seeks to provide theory and

9
00:00:31,456 --> 00:00:34,680
method to account for
human values in a principled and

10
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:37,852
systematic manner throughout
the design process.

11
00:00:37,852 --> 00:00:41,475
In this way, value sensitive design
is another dimension to consider when

12
00:00:41,475 --> 00:00:43,220
designing interfaces.

13
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:45,740
Not only is an interface useful
in accomplishing a task and

14
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:50,760
not only is it usable by the user, but
is it consistent with their values?

15
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:53,570
One of the most well-developed
application areas of value sensitive

16
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:56,190
design is privacy by design.

17
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:57,860
Privacy is a value, and

18
00:00:57,860 --> 00:01:02,660
privacy by design has aimed to preserve
that value in the design of systems.

19
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:05,590
It's possible to design
useful usable interfaces

20
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:07,810
that don't take privacy
into account anywhere.

21
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:11,470
That's what makes an examination of
user's values an extra dimension

22
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:12,430
of interface design.
