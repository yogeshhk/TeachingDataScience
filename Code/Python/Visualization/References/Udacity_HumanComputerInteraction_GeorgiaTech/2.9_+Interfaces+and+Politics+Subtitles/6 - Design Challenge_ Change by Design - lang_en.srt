00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:04,130
Let's tackle Change by Design by
designing something for Morgan.

2
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:06,190
So Morgan has a desk job.

3
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:08,780
That means she spends
a lot of her time sitting.

4
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:12,550
However, for health reasons, it's best
for her to get up once per hour and

5
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:14,490
walk around just for a few minutes.

6
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:17,290
There are a lot of way we could tackle
this by physically changing the design

7
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:20,860
of her environment to a standing desk or
by giving her an app that directly

8
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:23,750
reminds her or rewards her for
moving around.

9
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:26,630
But let's try to do something
a little bit more subtle.

10
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:30,107
So let's design something for Morgan's
smartphone that gets to move around for

11
00:00:30,107 --> 00:00:34,260
a couple minutes every hour without
directly reminding her to walk around or

12
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:35,620
rewarding her for doing so.
