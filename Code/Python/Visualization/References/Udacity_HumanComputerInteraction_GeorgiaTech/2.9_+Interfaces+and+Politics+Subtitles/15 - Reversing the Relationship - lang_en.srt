00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,180
We've talked a good bit about how
technology and interfaces can affect

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:06,340
politics and culture and society,
but we wouldn't be telling the whole

3
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:10,130
story if we didn't close by noting
the alternate relationship as well.

4
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:11,160
Political relationships and

5
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:15,010
motivations can often have an enormous
impact on the design of technology.

6
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:18,737
>From Bijker's book Of Bicycles,
Bakelites, and Bulbs, the bulbs part

7
00:00:18,737 --> 00:00:22,960
refers to the battle of the design of
the first flourescent lightbulb in 1938.

8
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,890
General Electric created a new
kind of light that was far more

9
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:27,190
energy efficient.

10
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:30,530
The power companies were afraid that
this would reduce power consumption and

11
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:32,380
cut into their profits.

12
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:35,500
After a long drawn out battle involving
the Anti Trust Division of the US

13
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:37,600
government and the US Department of War,

14
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,490
the fluorescent bulbs that were
ultimately sold were not as good as they

15
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:44,740
technologically could be in order to
preserve others' business interests.

16
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:47,420
That issue is more
prevalent today than ever.

17
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:50,720
More and more, we see compatibility
between devices and usage policies for

18
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:54,400
technologies determined not by
what's technologically possible but

19
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:57,180
by what satisfies political or
business needs.

20
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:58,550
So here's an example.

21
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:01,610
To keep up with everything that I like
to watch on TV I have five different

22
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:02,490
subscriptions.

23
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:07,630
I have cable TV, I have Hulu,
I have Amazon Prime, I have Netflix and

24
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:10,220
I have an HBO subscription on
top of my cable subscription.

25
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:12,270
And that's not to mention
things that I watch for

26
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:14,980
free on their own apps like Conan or
anything on YouTube.

27
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:18,090
And you might think wouldn't
it be awesome to just have

28
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:21,300
one experience that could navigate
among everything I want to watch.

29
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:24,170
And it would be awesome, and there's
no technological reason against it.

30
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:27,280
But there's a complicated web
of ownership and licensing and

31
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,200
intellectual property agreements that
determine the way that technology works.

32
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,030
Technology changes society but
society changes technology too.
