1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,130
We can design for
positive social changes well though.

2
00:00:03,130 --> 00:00:07,030
This goes beyond just encouraging people
to be nice or banning bad behavior.

3
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:10,210
Interfaces can be designed that'll
lead to positive social change through

4
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:12,450
natural interaction with the system.

5
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:16,219
One example of this that I like is
Facebook's ubiquitous Like button.

6
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:18,010
For years, many people have argued for

7
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:20,620
a Dislike button to
compliment the Like button.

8
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:22,530
Facebook has stuck with
the Like button though,

9
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:26,550
because by its design,
it only supports positive interactions.

10
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:29,630
It dodges cyberbullying,
it dodges negativity.

11
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:32,710
For usability purposes, it's a weakness
because there are interactions

12
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:35,360
I can't have naturally
in this interface.

13
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,370
But this specific part of
the Like button wasn't

14
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:39,520
designed with usability in mind.

15
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,376
More recently, Facebook has added to
the like button with five new emotions,

16
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:50,500
love, haha, wow, sad and angry.

17
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,440
Even with these five
new emotions though,

18
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:55,310
the overall connotation
is still positive.

19
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:57,100
For three of them, it's obvious why.

20
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:01,240
Love, haha and
wow are more positive emotions.

21
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:05,230
Sad and angry are negative emotions,
but used in this context,

22
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:08,000
they take on more of
a sympathetic connotation.

23
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,740
If someone is ranting about
getting into a car accident,

24
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:12,660
it seems to weird to like that.

25
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:14,690
But if you react with
this angry emoticon,

26
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:18,170
then you're basically saying
you're angry on their behalf.

27
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:21,020
It might be possible to use this for
the more negative connotation like if

28
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:23,830
someone said they like a political
candidate and you react angrily,

29
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:26,100
then you could be opposing
their political view.

30
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:27,670
But in the majority of cases,

31
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:31,560
these are still going to be used in
a way that fosters positive interaction.

32
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,500
So it seems that this interface
was designed to foster

33
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,770
positive social interactions online.

34
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:38,410
At the expense of usability,

35
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:42,380
it would come with supporting
all social interactions online.

36
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:45,460
This also doesn't have to be
strictly about dictating change, but

37
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:48,010
it can also be about supporting change.

38
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:49,960
For example, until a few years ago,

39
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:52,660
Facebook had a more limited
set of relationship options.

40
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:55,620
They had married, engaged,
in a relationship, single and

41
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:56,970
it's complicated.

42
00:01:56,970 --> 00:02:00,340
As it's target audience went from
being college students to everyone,

43
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:03,030
they also added separated,
divorced and widowed.

44
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:06,700
But it was a couple of years after that
that they then added in a civil union

45
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:08,669
and in a domestic partnership.

46
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:12,130
Adding these concepts didn't magically
create these social constructs,

47
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:14,640
they existed legally before
Facebook added them here.

48
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,602
But adding them here supported
an ongoing societal trend and

49
00:02:17,602 --> 00:02:18,888
gave them some validity.

50
00:02:18,888 --> 00:02:23,051
And made people for whom these were the
accurate relationship labels feel like

51
00:02:23,051 --> 00:02:26,017
they really were part of
Facebook's target audience,

52
00:02:26,017 --> 00:02:28,050
they were part of modern culture.

53
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:31,480
That an accurate representation of their
relationship status was available on

54
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:34,710
this drop down meant they could
accurately portray who they were on

55
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:35,470
their Facebook profile.

56
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,900
The same can be said for the more recent
trend to expand Facebook's gender

57
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:42,970
options to allow people to
put in a custom gender.

58
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:46,020
This supports a diverse group of
people feeling as if the interface

59
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:47,990
is designed with them in mind.

60
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:51,300
Which in turn supports society's
general movement towards acceptance.
