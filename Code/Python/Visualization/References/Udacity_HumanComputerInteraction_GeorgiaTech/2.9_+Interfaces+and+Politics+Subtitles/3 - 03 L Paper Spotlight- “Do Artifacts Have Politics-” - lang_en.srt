00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:06,450
The most influential paper on the inner play between

2
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:10,200
artifacts and politics came from Langdon Winner in 1980.

3
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:13,440
The paper describes numerous ways in which technologies, interfaces,

4
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:17,745
and other artifacts demonstrate political qualities, demonstrate political motivations.

5
00:00:17,745 --> 00:00:22,230
For example, he opens by noting the belief that nuclear power can only be

6
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:27,390
used in a totalitarian society because of the inherent danger of the technology.

7
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:29,385
Solar power on the other hand,

8
00:00:29,385 --> 00:00:33,225
pushes society towards a more distributed and egalitarian structure.

9
00:00:33,225 --> 00:00:37,650
But of course, we understand that nuclear power isn't on its own authoritarian.

10
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:38,850
It has no consciousness.

11
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:40,590
It can't take political power.

12
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:43,670
Winner is proposing that the push for certain technologies

13
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:47,285
carries with it certain necessary political adjustments.

14
00:00:47,285 --> 00:00:51,220
That's part of what it means to suggest that artifacts have politics.

15
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:56,360
In the paper, Winner outlines two distinct ways in which artifacts can be political.

16
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:59,645
One type is inherently political technologies.

17
00:00:59,645 --> 00:01:02,500
These are technologies that due to their very design,

18
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:05,630
are only compatible with certain political structures.

19
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:08,325
Certain technologies like nuclear power,

20
00:01:08,325 --> 00:01:09,730
whether due to complexity,

21
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:11,540
or safety, or resources,

22
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:14,150
require considerable top-down organization.

23
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:17,480
Those lend themselves to authoritarian power structures.

24
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:19,940
Others like solar power, someone might argue,

25
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:23,950
are only possible in a more distributed and egalitarian society.

26
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:27,050
So, these technologies by their very nature,

27
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:29,900
dictate the need for certain political structures.

28
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:34,285
The other type he discusses are technical arrangements as forms of order.

29
00:01:34,285 --> 00:01:39,925
Technologies can be used to achieve changes to social order when used in the correct way.

30
00:01:39,925 --> 00:01:44,510
The technology itself has no inherent political leanings like nuclear or solar power,

31
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:46,760
but it's used in a particular context for

32
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:50,365
a particular purpose can nonetheless accomplish some political goals.

33
00:01:50,365 --> 00:01:54,230
Winner uses the example of a factory in Chicago in the 1880s,

34
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:56,900
they replaced the workers with automated machines that produced

35
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:59,810
inferior goods as a way of busting up the Union.

36
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:02,105
The new technology was actually inferior,

37
00:02:02,105 --> 00:02:04,690
but it was used to serve a political purpose.

38
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:08,510
So, according to Winner, artifacts may have two kinds of politics;

39
00:02:08,510 --> 00:02:10,445
they may be inherently political,

40
00:02:10,445 --> 00:02:13,820
in that they're only compatible with certain forms of political order,

41
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:16,280
or they may be used to achieve political motives,

42
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:19,240
even though they have no inherent politics on their own.
