00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:01,260
In education,

2
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:04,630
a learning goal is something we want you
to understand at the end of the course.

3
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:07,450
It's the knowledge contained within your
head that you might not have had when we

4
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:08,720
got started.

5
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,610
In this class we have three
major learning goals.

6
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:14,600
First, we want you to understand
some of the common principles in

7
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:16,309
human computer interaction.

8
00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:19,480
These are the tried and true rules on
how to design good interactions between

9
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:21,490
humans and computers.

10
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:24,210
Second, we want you to
understand design life cycle.

11
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:28,108
That's how interfaces go from
conception to prototypes to evaluation.

12
00:00:28,108 --> 00:00:32,090
And we especially want you to understand
the roll of iteration in this process.

13
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:35,365
Third, we want you to understand the
expense of the human computer inherent

14
00:00:35,365 --> 00:00:38,348
interaction field and the current
applications available for HCI.

15
00:00:38,348 --> 00:00:40,800
HCI is really everywhere,
from domains like healthcare,

16
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:45,060
to technologies like virtual reality, to
emerging techniques like sonification.

17
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:47,630
We want you to understand the broad
range of application areas for

18
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:48,850
HCI in the modern world.
