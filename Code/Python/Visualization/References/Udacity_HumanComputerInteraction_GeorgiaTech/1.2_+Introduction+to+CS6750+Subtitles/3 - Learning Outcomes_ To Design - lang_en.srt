1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:04,110
While learning goal is something we want
you to know at the end of the course,

2
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:07,290
a learning outcome is something
we want you to be able to do.

3
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:09,210
This course really has
one learning outcomes but

4
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:11,460
there are some nuances to it.

5
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:14,120
The learning outcome for
this course is to be able to design

6
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:17,090
effective interactions
between humans and computers.

7
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:20,450
The first part of this
learning outcome is to design.

8
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:21,940
But what is design?

9
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:24,540
Well for
us design is going to take two forms.

10
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:27,760
First, design is an activity where
you're appl known principles

11
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,110
to a new problem.

12
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:31,650
For example we'll talk a lot about
the importance of getting users to write

13
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:33,480
kind of feedback at the right time.

14
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:37,530
That's a plan of principle of feedback
to some new design problem ww encounter.

15
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:40,770
But design is a second form as well,
design is also a process where

16
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:43,730
you gather information,
use it to develop design alternatives,

17
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:46,660
evaluate them with users and
revise them accordingly.

18
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:48,300
When designing interface for some tasks,

19
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:51,095
I would ask some potential users how
they perform some task right now.

20
00:00:51,095 --> 00:00:54,140
I develop multiple different ideas for
how we can help them.

21
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:55,580
I give those to the users to evaluate,
and

22
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:59,750
I will use the experiences to try to
improve the interface on that time.

23
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:01,300
So let's take an example of this.

24
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:03,830
Imagine I was designing
a new thermostat.

25
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:06,800
On the one hand, designing a new
thermostat means applying known

26
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:11,310
HCR principles, like feedback and
error tolerance to some new design.

27
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:13,990
On the other hand, designing
a new thermostat means creating

28
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:16,750
different ideas, giving them to users,
getting their feedback and

29
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:18,980
then revising those designs.

30
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:21,410
Both these sides of design
are very important.

31
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:22,140
You don't want to ignore

32
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:25,820
decades of experience when designing new
interfaces, but simply applying known

33
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:29,220
principles to a new problem doesn't
guarantee you have a good design.

34
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:31,100
Designing is about both these things.

35
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:34,440
And in fact, these two things are a vast
majority of material that we'll cover in

36
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:35,420
this course.

37
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:38,280
We'll cover the principles uncovered
by a human factors engineering and

38
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,220
human computer interaction research.

39
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:43,150
And we'll cover the methods
used in the HCI.

40
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:45,630
We're gathering user requirements,
developing designs, and

41
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:46,730
evaluating new interfaces.
