00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:04,640
Learning strategies are how we plan to
actually impart that knowledge to you.

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:07,100
This is how we attempt to help you
achieve the learning goals and

3
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:08,630
learning outcomes.

4
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:11,380
Within these videos, we'll use a number
of different strategies to try to help

5
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:14,680
you understand the core principles and
methodologies of HCI.

6
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:16,320
We'll use learning by example.

7
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,670
Every lesson and, in fact,
this course, as a whole.

8
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:21,440
Is organized around a collection of
running examples that will come up

9
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:23,110
over and over again.

10
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:24,600
We use learning by doing.

11
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,390
Throughout the course we'll ask you to
engage in designing interactions to

12
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:30,040
solve different problems
in different contexts.

13
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:30,730
These aren't required,

14
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:33,370
since there's really no way we can
verify if you've done them, but

15
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:36,050
we really hope you'll take a few
minutes and think about these.

16
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:37,930
We'll also use learning
by reflection a lot.

17
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:40,690
We'll ask yo to reflect on times when
you've encountered these things in your

18
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:41,390
own every day life.

19
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:45,480
These strategies are useful because they
connect to your own personal experiences

20
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:46,810
but once again, there's a danger here.

21
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:49,560
One of the recurrent
points in HCI is that

22
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:52,910
when you are designing interactions,
you are not your own user.

23
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:56,400
Focusing too much on your own
experiences can give you a false sense

24
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,620
of expertise.

25
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:00,960
So I'll use some strategies to help
take you out of that comfort zone and

26
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,160
confront how little you might understand
these tasks with which you thought you

27
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:04,810
were so familiar.
