00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:06,905
Here are five quick tips for doing well in this course.

2
00:00:06,905 --> 00:00:09,960
Number one, look over the assignments early.

3
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:12,660
Some of our assignments, you can sit down and do them in an hour.

4
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:15,810
But others require some advanced coordination to talk to users,

5
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:18,360
develop prototypes, or test with real people.

6
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:21,255
So, go ahead and at least read all the assignment descriptions.

7
00:00:21,255 --> 00:00:23,835
Number two, start the assignments early.

8
00:00:23,835 --> 00:00:25,650
That's not just typical teacher talks saying,

9
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:27,150
"You can't get this done at the last minute."

10
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:30,970
You probably can. But you're using interfaces like these in your everyday life.

11
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:35,075
By starting early, you're likely to get inspiration just in your day-to-day routine,

12
00:00:35,075 --> 00:00:37,340
and that's going to make writing the assignments significantly

13
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:40,430
easier than trying to sit down and come up with something on the spot.

14
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:42,640
Number three, participate.

15
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,160
Interact with your classmates.

16
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,335
Post on the forums, read others posts.

17
00:00:46,335 --> 00:00:48,830
The knowledge and experience you gain there is just as

18
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:51,965
valuable as anything you'll get listening to me and these videos.

19
00:00:51,965 --> 00:00:55,750
Number four, select an application area to explore.

20
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:57,620
Next lesson, you'll hear about several of

21
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:01,175
the interesting areas of HCI research and development going on right now.

22
00:01:01,175 --> 00:01:04,340
Developing in many of these areas is outside the scope of this class.

23
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:06,930
But I encourage you to pick an area in which you're interested,

24
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:09,155
and mentally revisit it throughout the course.

25
00:01:09,155 --> 00:01:13,230
Number five, leave behind what you know or at least try.

26
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:15,030
HCI is a huge area.

27
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:18,620
Yet, many people believe that because they're already good at using computers,

28
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:20,905
they'd be good at designing user experiences.

29
00:01:20,905 --> 00:01:25,220
But HCI above all else is about gaining a grounded understanding of the user's needs,

30
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:27,110
not assuming we already understand them.

31
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:30,590
So, while it's great to apply the courses' principles to your everyday life,

32
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:35,490
be cautious about designing to narrowly based only on your own experiences.
