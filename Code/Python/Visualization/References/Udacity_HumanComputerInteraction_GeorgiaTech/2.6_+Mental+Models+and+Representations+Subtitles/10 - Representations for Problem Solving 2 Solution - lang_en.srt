1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:01,520
If you solved it,

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:04,950
well done on figuring it out despite
such a terrible representation.

3
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:07,710
Or congratulations on
recognizing by analogy,

4
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:10,600
that it's the same as a problem
you've seen in another class.

5
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:12,660
If you skipped it, I don't blame you.

6
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:14,210
It's not an easy problem.

7
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:17,370
But it's even harder when
the representation is so poor.

8
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:19,830
There were lots of weaknesses
in that representation.

9
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:22,240
Let's step through how
we would improve it.

10
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:25,230
The first thing we could do is
simply write the problem out.

11
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:28,360
Audio is a poor representation
of complex problems.

12
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:31,570
So here's a written
representation of the problem.

13
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:34,530
If the trouble you were having solving
the exercise was just remembering

14
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:37,980
all the rules, having this written
down would be a huge help.

15
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:40,520
But we can still do
a lot better than this.

16
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:43,710
Instead, we can represent
the problem visually.

17
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:46,670
Here we have the shapes,
the three circles and the three squares.

18
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:49,136
And we can imagine actually
moving them back and forth.

19
00:00:51,675 --> 00:00:56,390
That arrow in the center, represents
the direction of the next move.

20
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:58,060
But we can still do better.

21
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:01,680
Right now we have to work to compare
the number of squares and circles, so

22
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:02,940
let's line them up.

23
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:04,510
This makes it very easy to compare and

24
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:07,350
make sure that the circles
always outnumber the squares.

25
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:09,238
And we can still do
the same manipulation,

26
00:01:09,238 --> 00:01:10,503
moving them back and forth.

27
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:15,503
Now the only remaining problem is that
we have to keep in working memory,

28
00:01:15,503 --> 00:01:18,730
the rule that squares may
not outnumber circles.

29
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:21,430
There is no natural reason why
need more squares than circles,

30
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:23,570
it's just kind of an arbitrary rule.

31
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:25,540
So let's make it more self evident.

32
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:28,820
Let's make the squares wolves,
and the circles sheep.

33
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:30,570
As long as the sheep
outnumber the wolves,

34
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:32,750
the sheep can defend themselves,
kind of.

35
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:35,740
But if the wolves ever outnumber
the sheep, they'll eat them.

36
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:38,470
But if there are no sheep, then there's
nothing for the wolves to eat, so

37
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:39,700
that's okay.

38
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:41,510
So now we have a new
representation of the problem,

39
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:44,190
one that will make the problem
much easier to solve.

40
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:46,970
The rules are more obvious, and
it's easier to evaluate whether or

41
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:48,410
not they're being met.

42
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:51,840
Finally, we can make this visualization
even a little bit more useful,

43
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,820
by actually showing the movements
between different states.

44
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:57,313
That way we can see that for
any state in the problem,

45
00:01:57,313 --> 00:01:59,588
there's a finite number
of next legal states.

46
00:01:59,588 --> 00:02:02,782
This would also allow us to notice
when we've accidentally revisited

47
00:02:02,782 --> 00:02:05,930
an earlier state, so
we can avoid going around in circles.

48
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:08,970
So for example, from this state,
we might choose to move the wolf and

49
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:10,680
the sheep back to the left, but

50
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:13,280
we'll immediately notice that would
make the state the same as this one.

51
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,700
And it's not useful to backtrack and
revisit an earlier state.

52
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:18,510
So we know not to do that.

53
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:22,640
So these representations have made it
much easier to solve this problem,

54
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,550
than just the verbal
representation we started with.
