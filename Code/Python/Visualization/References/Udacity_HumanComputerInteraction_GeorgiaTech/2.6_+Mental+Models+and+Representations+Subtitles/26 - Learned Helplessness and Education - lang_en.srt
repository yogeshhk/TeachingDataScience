00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:03,830
Just like mental models, learned
helplessness is also a topic related as

2
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:06,530
much to education as it is to HCI.

3
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:08,210
If you've ever spent any
time in a teaching role,

4
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:11,740
you very likely encountered students
that are very resistant to being taught.

5
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:14,660
And the reason is they have learned
that no matter what they do,

6
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:16,100
they never succeed.

7
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:20,030
They've learned to be helpless
based on their past experiences.

8
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:22,570
In all likelihood, there have
actually been situations where

9
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:24,610
you've been the one learning
that you're helpless.

10
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:25,920
In fact, if you're a parent,

11
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,720
I can almost guarantee you've
been in that situation.

12
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:31,440
There are times when your child
was crying and inconsolable and

13
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:32,910
you had no clue why.

14
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:35,210
We had one of those right
before we filmed this video.

15
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:36,540
Nothing you did helped.

16
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:40,320
And you learned that you were helpless
to figure out what your child wanted.

17
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,430
So if you're a parent and

18
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:44,190
you're dealing with learned
helplessness as an interface designer,

19
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:48,030
just imagine that you are the user and
the interface is your screaming child.

20
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:48,790
What feedback would

21
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:51,290
you need from your child to
figure out how you can help them?

22
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:54,604
And how can you build that kind
of feedback into your interface?
