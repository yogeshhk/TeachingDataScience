00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:03,320
A mental model is a person's
understanding of the way something in

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:04,850
the real world works.

3
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:07,370
It's an understanding of the processes,
relationships and

4
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:08,890
connections in real systems.

5
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:13,170
Using mental models we generate
expectations or predictions about

6
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:17,480
the world and then we check whether the
actual outcomes match our mental model.

7
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:19,990
So I'm holding this basketball
because generally, we

8
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:22,775
all probably have a model of what will
happen if I try to bounce this ball.

9
00:00:22,775 --> 00:00:24,464
[SOUND] It comes back up.

10
00:00:24,464 --> 00:00:28,680
[SOUND] You didn't have to see it
come up to know what would happen.

11
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:31,520
You use your mental model of
the world to simulate the event.

12
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:35,460
And then you use that mental
simulation to make predictions.

13
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:41,010
When reality doesn't match with our
mental model, it makes us uncomfortable.

14
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:43,570
We want to know why our
mental model was wrong.

15
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:45,310
Maybe it makes us curious.

16
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:48,200
But when it happens over and
over, it can frustrate us.

17
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:51,830
It can make us feel that we just
don't and never will understand.

18
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:55,110
As interface designers, this presents
us with a lot of challenges.

19
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:57,900
We want to make sure that the users
mental model in our systems matches

20
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:00,250
the way our systems actually work.

21
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:02,510
We can do that in two primary ways,

22
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:06,920
one by designing systems that act the
way people already expect them to act.

23
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:08,775
And two, by designing systems that,

24
00:01:08,775 --> 00:01:12,505
by their very nature,
teach people how they'll act.

25
00:01:12,505 --> 00:01:16,042
That way we can minimize the discomfort
that comes from systems acting ways that

26
00:01:16,042 --> 00:01:17,062
users don't expect.
