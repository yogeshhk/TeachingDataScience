1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,274
The most powerful tool in our arsenal to
help ensure users have effective mental

2
00:00:04,274 --> 00:00:07,030
models of our systems is representation.

3
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:09,630
We get to choose how things
are visualized to users, and so

4
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:13,390
we get to choose some of how
their mental model develops.

5
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:17,009
Using good representations can make all
the difference between effective and

6
00:00:17,009 --> 00:00:18,392
ineffective mental models.

7
00:00:18,392 --> 00:00:22,590
So to take an example, let's look at
some instructions for assembling things.

8
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:25,603
So here are the instructions for
a cat tree that I recently put together.

9
00:00:25,603 --> 00:00:28,180
At first, I actually thought this
was a pretty good representation.

10
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:31,720
You can kind of see how things fit
together from the bottom to the top.

11
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:35,500
The problem is that this representation
doesn't actually map the physical

12
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:37,750
construction of the cat tree itself.

13
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:41,320
You can even see some bizarre mismatches
even within this representation.

14
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:43,146
Up here, it looks like this
pillar is in the front, but

15
00:00:43,146 --> 00:00:45,227
the screw hole that goes into it
is actually shown in the back.

16
00:00:45,227 --> 00:00:47,553
But we're not looking up into
the bottom of that piece,

17
00:00:47,553 --> 00:00:50,241
because in the middle piece,
they actually map up pretty well.

18
00:00:50,241 --> 00:00:51,541
At least with the way
they're shown here.

19
00:00:51,541 --> 00:00:54,000
Again, that isn't the way
the actual piece works.

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,960
So anyway, the point is,
this is a poor representation for

21
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,710
the way this furniture actually worked,

22
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:02,950
because it wasn't a real mapping between
this representation and the real pieces.

23
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:05,730
Lately I also put together
some office furniture, and

24
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:08,140
that actually had a very
good representation.

25
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:11,480
These are two of the steps from a hutch
I put together to go over my desk.

26
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:14,610
For the piece on the left, there was
a perfect mapping between the way this

27
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:18,620
piece worked and the way the screw holes
were actually aligned on the piece.

28
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:21,328
One clever thing they did is
they actually showed this little

29
00:01:21,328 --> 00:01:23,730
screw hole right here that
isn't used for this step.

30
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:27,760
That helped me understand the mapping
between this piece and my piece.

31
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:30,268
And understand that when I saw that
screw hole that didn't have a screw for

32
00:01:30,268 --> 00:01:30,967
it, that was okay.

33
00:01:30,967 --> 00:01:33,505
It would be natural to
think we only need to show

34
00:01:33,505 --> 00:01:35,280
what users actually need to do.

35
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,200
But including that screw hole
helps users understand the mapping

36
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:41,430
between this representation and
the actual piece.

37
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:44,280
This more complicated step over on
the right actually ended up being pretty

38
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,460
intuitive as well.

39
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:46,270
Although it's small and

40
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:49,860
the details hard to see, the arrows they
put along here made it pretty easy to

41
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:53,320
see the direction you had to move things
in order to put these pieces together.

42
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:55,680
That's especially useful
in places like up here,

43
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,600
where the screw hole actually
isn't visible in this diagram.

44
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:02,110
But I can see that there is a screw hole
here because of the way they represented

45
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:03,622
this screw going into that hole.

46
00:02:03,622 --> 00:02:06,618
I can look at the arrangement of
these pieces and get a good feel for

47
00:02:06,618 --> 00:02:08,919
how the pieces are meant
to fit together.

48
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:11,840
So this representation helps me
understand the problem in a way

49
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,500
that the other representation did not.
