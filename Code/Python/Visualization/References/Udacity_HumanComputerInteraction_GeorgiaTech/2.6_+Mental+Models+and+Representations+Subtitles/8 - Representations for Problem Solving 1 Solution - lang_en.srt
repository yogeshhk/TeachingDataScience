1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:01,940
Let's watch that animation again.

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:08,308
The hiker goes up the hill on one day,
stays the night.

3
00:00:10,217 --> 00:00:11,860
And then goes back down
the hill the next day.

4
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:15,520
And we want to know,

5
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:19,420
was the hiker ever at the same point
at the same time on both days?

6
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:20,680
And the answer is yes.

7
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:22,460
Describe the way we
describe it right here,

8
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:25,180
it might actually seem odd that
there is a point where the hiker is

9
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:27,520
in the same place at
the same time on both days.

10
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:29,550
That seems like a strange coincidence,
but

11
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:31,990
what if we tweak
the representation a little bit?

12
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:35,990
Instead of one hiker going up and
then coming down the next day.

13
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:37,900
Let's visualize the two
days at the same time.

14
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:41,270
If we represent the problem like this,

15
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:45,370
we'll quickly see the hiker
has to pass himself.

16
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:48,550
To show it again,
we know the answer is yes,

17
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:51,290
because there's a time when the hiker
would have passed himself if he was

18
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:53,740
going in both directions
on the same day.

19
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:57,370
And to pass himself, he has to be
in the same point at the same time.

20
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:02,330
That representation took a hard
problem and made it very easy.
