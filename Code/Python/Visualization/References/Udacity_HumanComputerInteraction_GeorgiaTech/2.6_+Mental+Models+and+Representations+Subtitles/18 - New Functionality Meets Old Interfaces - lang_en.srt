00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:04,040
In designing interfaces, we want to
leverage analogies to the real world,

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:07,060
and principles from past
interfaces whenever possible,

3
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:09,470
to help the user learn the new
interface as quickly as they can.

4
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:12,110
But there's a challenge here.

5
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:15,960
Why are we designing technology if
we're not providing users anything new?

6
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18,220
It's one thing to take the technology
they're already using, and

7
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:19,700
make it more usable.

8
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:22,410
But generally, we also want to enable
people to do things they've never

9
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:23,710
done before.

10
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:27,330
That means there are no analogies, no
expectations, no prior experiences for

11
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:28,900
them leverage.

12
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:32,009
How do you tell someone that's used
to control their own thermostat that

13
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:33,720
they don't need to anymore.

14
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:37,230
So, while we need to leverage analogy
and prior experience wherever possible.

15
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:39,250
We also need to be
aware that eventually,

16
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:42,190
we're going to do something interesting,
and they're going to break down.

17
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:45,815
Eventually, we're going to have to teach
the user to use the unique elements of

18
00:00:45,815 --> 00:00:46,583
our interface.
