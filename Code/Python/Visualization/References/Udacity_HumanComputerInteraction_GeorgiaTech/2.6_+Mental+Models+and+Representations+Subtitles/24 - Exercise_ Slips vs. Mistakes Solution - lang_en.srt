1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,100
I would argue this is a slip.

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:03,910
Morgan knows who she
means to message but

3
00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:07,130
the phone's behavior tricks her into
sending things to the wrong people.

4
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:11,270
What's more, this might be either an
action based slip or memory lapse slip.

5
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:12,780
Maybe Morgan is tapping
the wrong person,

6
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:15,320
or maybe she's forgetting to
check who she's messaging.

7
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:18,130
So take a second and brainstorm a design
for this that can prevent this from

8
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:21,970
happening in the future without over
complicating the interaction too much.

9
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:24,520
I would argue that the best way
to do this is simply to show

10
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:27,600
more pervasive reminders of who
Morgan is currently texting.

11
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:30,590
We could show the recipient's picture
on the send button, for example.

12
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:32,912
That way,
the interaction is no more complex, but

13
00:00:32,912 --> 00:00:36,590
Morgan also has to directly acknowledge
who she's messaging to send a message.
