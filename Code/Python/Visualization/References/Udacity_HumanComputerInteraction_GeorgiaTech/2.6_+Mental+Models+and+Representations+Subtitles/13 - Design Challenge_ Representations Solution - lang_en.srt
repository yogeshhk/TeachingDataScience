1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,110
There are a number of
things we can do here.

2
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:04,480
The simplest change we could make
would simply be to make the breakers

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:05,890
themselves writable.

4
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:08,210
Instead of writing a list on the left
that we have to then map up to

5
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:09,440
the breakers themselves on the right,

6
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:11,970
we could just write on each
breaker what it controls.

7
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:14,595
That way we just have to look at the
breakers themselves to find the breaker

8
00:00:14,595 --> 00:00:16,055
that we're interested in.

9
00:00:16,055 --> 00:00:19,095
But then they still have to
manually scan through all of them.

10
00:00:19,095 --> 00:00:21,925
We could further augment this by having
a floor plan over here that actually

11
00:00:21,925 --> 00:00:24,335
gives the numbers on the floor plan for
the breaker we want.

12
00:00:24,335 --> 00:00:27,207
So all I have to do is jump straight
to the room that I'm interested in,

13
00:00:27,207 --> 00:00:29,447
find the number,
go over the the list of breakers, and

14
00:00:29,447 --> 00:00:32,299
the label written on it would then
confirm that I chose the right one.

15
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:35,288
Now, if we wanted to get really crazy
we could actually lay out the breakers

16
00:00:35,288 --> 00:00:37,100
themselves to correspond
to the floor plan.

17
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:37,890
We can have a floor plan and

18
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:41,010
actually put the breakers on
the floors that they control.

19
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:43,035
Or we could even just put
the breakers in the rooms themselves.

20
00:00:43,035 --> 00:00:44,745
So if the power goes
out to a certain room,

21
00:00:44,745 --> 00:00:47,015
I just go find the breaker in that room.

22
00:00:47,015 --> 00:00:49,215
But there we're starting to run into
some of the other constraints on

23
00:00:49,215 --> 00:00:49,735
the problems.

24
00:00:49,735 --> 00:00:52,585
So it's probably best to stick to what
we can control, without requiring

25
00:00:52,585 --> 00:00:55,435
that the physical device be manufactured
differently in the first place.
