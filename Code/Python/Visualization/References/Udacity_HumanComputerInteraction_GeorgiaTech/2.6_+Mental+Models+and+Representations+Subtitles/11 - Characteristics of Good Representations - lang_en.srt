1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,980
What are the characteristics
of a good representation?

2
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:06,970
First, good representations
make relationships explicit.

3
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:09,890
Laying things out like this makes it
easy to tell that there are more sheep

4
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:10,920
than wolves.

5
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:14,990
Second, good representations bring
objects and relationships together.

6
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:18,450
Representing these as wolves and sheep,
makes that relationship that the sheep

7
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:22,280
must out number the wolves much more
salient than using squares and circles.

8
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:25,840
That brings the objects together
with the relationships between them.

9
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:29,720
Third, a good representation
excludes extraneous details.

10
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:30,260
For example,

11
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:34,470
sometimes this problem is described in
the form of having a river and a boat.

12
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:37,940
But those details aren't actually
relevant to solving the problem at all.

13
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:39,480
So, we've left them out of here.

14
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:42,110
All we need to know is they need to
move from the left to the right.

15
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:43,220
Doesn't matter if it's a river,

16
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:46,070
doesn't matter if it's a boat, this
is all the information that we need.

17
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:48,880
So we left out
the extraneous information.

18
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:52,350
Fourth, good representations
expose natural constraints.

19
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:55,400
We describe these as sheep and wolves
because it makes it easier to think

20
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,910
about the rule that wolves
may never out number sheep.

21
00:00:57,910 --> 00:01:00,860
Now of course, this isn't the best
rule because we know that sheep

22
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:02,820
can't actually defend
themselves against wolves.

23
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:05,379
Three sheep and one wolf,
the wolf would still win.

24
00:01:05,379 --> 00:01:08,310
However, if we visualize these
as guards and prisoners instead,

25
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:11,230
it involves holding and
working memory the idea that

26
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:14,790
prisoners inexplicably won't flee
if they're left without any guards.

27
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:17,470
So personally, I think the wolves and
sheep metaphor is better.

28
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:20,500
But perhaps the original name
of the problem is even better.

29
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:23,930
This was originally described as
the cannibals and missionaries problem.

30
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:26,280
It makes more sense that a missionary
could defend themselves against

31
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:29,430
a cannibal than a sheep could
defend themselves against a wolf.

32
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:32,280
But the cannibals and missionaries
problem makes it a little bit dark.

33
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,170
So let's stick with sheep and wolves.
