1
00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:04,019
So let's talk a little bit about mental
models in the context of the climate

2
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:06,140
control systems we see on automobiles.

3
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:09,270
So this is my old car,
it's a 1989 Volvo.

4
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:10,530
It, sadly, does not run anymore.

5
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:13,540
But let's talk about how the climate
control system would work back when

6
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:14,080
it did run.

7
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:17,020
So, it's a hot day outside.

8
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:20,920
Looking at these controls, how would
you make the air temperature colder and

9
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:23,080
the air come out faster?

10
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:27,180
The natural thought to me would be to
turn the fan speed up over on the right,

11
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:30,690
and the air temperature to
the blue side over on the left.

12
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:33,080
But this doesn't actually make
the temperature any colder,

13
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:35,340
it just disables the heat.

14
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:37,310
This dial over here in the top right,

15
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:40,720
has to be turned on to make the air
conditioning actually work.

16
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:43,380
So just turning this thing over to
the blue side doesn't actually turn on

17
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:44,810
the air conditioning.

18
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:49,599
So to make it colder, you have to both
slide this lever over to the left, and

19
00:00:49,599 --> 00:00:51,590
turn this dial to the red area.

20
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:53,218
It's kind of hard to see in this, but

21
00:00:53,218 --> 00:00:57,410
this little area over here on the left
side of this dial is actually red.

22
00:00:57,410 --> 00:01:02,190
The red area on the air conditioning
control designates the maximum coldness.

23
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,180
What?

24
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:07,220
This also means you can turn on both
the heat and the air conditioning at

25
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:11,110
the same time and have neither of them
blowing out if your fan is turned off.

26
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:15,030
None of these really match my mental
model of how this system works and

27
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:18,110
the colors used here do nothing
to correct my mental model.

28
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:18,970
There's a control here

29
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:21,890
that if you turn it to blue
doesn't make the car any colder.

30
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:25,535
And if you turn this other control
to red, it does make the car colder.

31
00:01:25,535 --> 00:01:27,015
What?

32
00:01:27,015 --> 00:01:28,955
So back in 1989,
there was a lot of room for

33
00:01:28,955 --> 00:01:32,215
improvement on designing the climate
control system for a car like this.

34
00:01:32,215 --> 00:01:34,635
Let's see if we actually did improve
that by talking about my new car,

35
00:01:34,635 --> 00:01:37,375
which is a 2015 Nissan Leaf.

36
00:01:37,375 --> 00:01:41,405
So in the 26 years since my old Volvo
came out, have we gotten better at this?

37
00:01:41,405 --> 00:01:42,776
Well yeah,
we've gotten a good bit better,

38
00:01:42,776 --> 00:01:44,630
although there's still a good
bit of room for improvement.

39
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:46,830
So, here's the climate
control system from my Leaf.

40
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:49,793
I have one dial,
that turns the fan speed up and down.

41
00:01:49,793 --> 00:01:53,240
One dial that turns the temperature
of the air coming out up and down.

42
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:55,850
And so as far as that's concerned,
it's pretty simple.

43
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:59,280
But this interface still has some
things that are pretty confusing.

44
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,104
So for example,
it has an automatic mode,

45
00:02:01,104 --> 00:02:04,041
where it tries to adjust the air
temperature and the fan speed to bring

46
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:06,543
the temperature of the car to
the temperature that I want.

47
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:08,190
So I press auto.

48
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:11,150
Now it's going to change the fan speed,
and change the air temperature, if

49
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:14,830
I didn't already have it at the lowest,
to try and get the car cooler faster.

50
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:20,410
The problem is that I want to turn auto
off, I don't actually know how to do it.

51
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:22,590
Pressing auto doesn't
actually turn it off.

52
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:23,260
If I turn it so

53
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:27,630
that it doesn't only circulate air
inside the car, then it turns auto off.

54
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:28,980
But that might not be what I wanted.

55
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:31,660
Maybe I wanted it to go to
a certain air temperature without

56
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:33,390
just circulating the air in the car.

57
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:36,010
I turn auto back on,
it's going to turn that back on.

58
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:36,560
Don't know why.

59
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,770
So right now, as far as I know,

60
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:41,700
the only way to turn auto off is
to turn the circulation mode off.

61
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,864
It also lets me turn AC and
heat on at the same time,

62
00:02:43,864 --> 00:02:45,374
which I don't understand at all.

63
00:02:45,374 --> 00:02:46,740
Why would I ever need that?

64
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:49,450
So there are some things that
the system really should do better, or

65
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:52,630
some things that it should constrain so
the user doesn't do things

66
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:55,280
that don't make sense in the context
of wanting to set the temperature.
