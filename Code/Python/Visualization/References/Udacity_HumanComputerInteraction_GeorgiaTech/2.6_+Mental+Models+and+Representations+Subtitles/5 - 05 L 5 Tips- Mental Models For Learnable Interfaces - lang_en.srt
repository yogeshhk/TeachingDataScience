00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:07,245
Matching our interface design to users' mental models is

2
00:00:07,245 --> 00:00:11,340
a valuable way to create interfaces that are easily learnable by users.

3
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:13,045
Here are five tips or, in this case,

4
00:00:13,045 --> 00:00:16,289
principles to leverage for creating learnable interfaces.

5
00:00:16,289 --> 00:00:19,170
These principles of learnability were proposed by Dix, Finlay,

6
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:22,620
Abowd, and Beale in their book, Human-Computer Interaction.

7
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:26,670
Number one, predictability. Look at an action.

8
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:28,725
Can the user predict what will happen?

9
00:00:28,725 --> 00:00:31,230
For example, graying out a button is a good way to help

10
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:34,170
the user predict that clicking that button will do nothing.

11
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:37,170
Number two, synthesizability.

12
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:39,030
Not only should the user be able to predict

13
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:41,110
the effects of an action before they perform it,

14
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:45,425
they should also be able to see the sequence of actions that led to their current state.

15
00:00:45,425 --> 00:00:48,440
That can be difficult in graphical user interfaces but something

16
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:52,195
like the log of actions that they can see in the undo menu can make it easier.

17
00:00:52,195 --> 00:00:54,530
Command line interfaces are actually really good at this.

18
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:57,605
They give a log of the commands that have been given in order.

19
00:00:57,605 --> 00:01:00,260
Number three, familiarity.

20
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:03,200
This is similar to Norman's principle of affordances.

21
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,480
The interface should leverage actions with which the user

22
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,925
is already familiar from real-world experience.

23
00:01:07,925 --> 00:01:11,329
For example, if you're trying to indicate something is either good or bad,

24
00:01:11,329 --> 00:01:14,675
you'd likely want to use red and green instead of blue and yellow.

25
00:01:14,675 --> 00:01:17,615
Number four, generalizability.

26
00:01:17,615 --> 00:01:21,150
Similar to familiarity in the Norman's principles of consistency,

27
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:24,520
knowledge of one user interface should generalize to others.

28
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:27,590
If your interfaces tasks that are similar to other interfaces tasks,

29
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:29,960
like saving and copying and pasting,

30
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:32,630
it should perform those tasks in the same way.

31
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:35,120
Number five, consistency.

32
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:38,015
This is slightly different than Norman's principle of consistency.

33
00:01:38,015 --> 00:01:40,160
This means it's similar tasks or operations

34
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:43,180
within a single interface should behave the same way.

35
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:47,695
For example, you wouldn't want to have ctrl x cut some texts if texts are selected,

36
00:01:47,695 --> 00:01:50,320
but close the application if there is no text selected.

37
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:54,235
The behavior of that action should be consistent across the interface.

38
00:01:54,235 --> 00:01:57,800
Using these principles can help the user leverage their existing mental models of

39
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:02,710
other designs as well as develop a mental model of your interface as quickly as possible.
