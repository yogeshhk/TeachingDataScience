00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,875
Analogies and metaphors are powerful tools for helping users understand your interface.

2
00:00:04,875 --> 00:00:07,545
If you can ground your interface in something they already know,

3
00:00:07,545 --> 00:00:11,315
you can get a solid foundation in teaching them how to use your interface.

4
00:00:11,315 --> 00:00:14,130
For example, The Wall Street Journal's website heavily

5
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:17,170
leverages an analogy to The Wall Street Journal print edition.

6
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:18,660
The headlines, the grids,

7
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:20,720
the text all appear pretty similarly,

8
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,860
so someone familiar with the print edition could

9
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:25,270
pretty easily understand the online edition.

10
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:28,550
If you've ever tried to explain a tool that you use to someone who's never seen it,

11
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:30,565
you've probably encountered something like this.

12
00:00:30,565 --> 00:00:34,330
For example, both at Udacity and in the Georgia Tech OMSCS program,

13
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:36,485
we use Slack for communicating with each other.

14
00:00:36,485 --> 00:00:38,405
If you've never actually seen Slack,

15
00:00:38,405 --> 00:00:40,610
it's a chat app for organizations to talk in

16
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:43,940
different public and private rooms but listen to what I just said.

17
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:45,250
It's a chat app.

18
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:48,980
In my description, I leveraged the analogy to something you've already seen.

19
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:52,710
Now Slack is a pretty easy example because it is a chat app.

20
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:56,420
It's barely even an analogy to say it's like a chat app because it is a chat app.

21
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:58,640
It's a very full featured chat app with a lot of

22
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,865
integrations and things like that but it's fundamentally a chat app.

23
00:01:01,865 --> 00:01:04,990
What about something harder? How about Medium?

24
00:01:04,990 --> 00:01:07,880
Medium is a writing platform that's kind of like

25
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:09,810
a blogging service but also kind of like

26
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:12,395
a publishing service but also kind of like a news feed.

27
00:01:12,395 --> 00:01:16,700
You write articles kind of like WordPress blog posts but you can publish them through

28
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:18,860
organizations which is kind of like

29
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:22,190
traditional newspapers or news aggregators like the Huffington Post.

30
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:25,200
My articles for example are published through Udacity.

31
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,890
So, it's not just like a blog because it's not just my personal blog.

32
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:30,200
There is a publisher element to it but

33
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:33,575
the actual content is very similar to a blog-like platform.

34
00:01:33,575 --> 00:01:37,140
Articles are then published to interested people more like a news feed.

35
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:38,425
So if I scroll down,

36
00:01:38,425 --> 00:01:40,970
I'll see the articles that Medium thinks I would be interested in

37
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:44,480
reading and in that way it's more like Facebook or Twitter.

38
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,910
So, notice that my entire explanation of Medium was

39
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:49,819
based on analogies to other services like WordPress,

40
00:01:49,819 --> 00:01:51,515
Huffington Post, and Facebook.

41
00:01:51,515 --> 00:01:53,990
But analogies and metaphors have a downside.

42
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:55,370
When you choose to use them,

43
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:57,910
users don't know where the analogy ends.

44
00:01:57,910 --> 00:02:01,635
When I describe Medium's news feed is kind of like Facebook or kind of like Twitter,

45
00:02:01,635 --> 00:02:04,800
users might wonder where the retweet or share options are.

46
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,700
Or when I describe it like a blog platform like WordPress,

47
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:09,680
people might wonder where the comments are and it doesn't

48
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,920
really supply comments in the way that we're used to.

49
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:16,160
So, while analogies are powerful ways to help users understand our interfaces,

50
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:20,610
we also need to pay special attention to what misconceptions they might introduce.
