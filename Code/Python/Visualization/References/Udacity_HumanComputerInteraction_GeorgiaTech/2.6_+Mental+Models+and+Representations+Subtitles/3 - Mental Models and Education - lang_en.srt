00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,710
Mental models are not
a uniquely HCI principle.

2
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:07,340
In fact, if you search for mental models
online, you'll probably find just as

3
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:10,590
much about them in the context of
education, as the context of HCI.

4
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:14,420
And that's actually a very
useful analogy to keep in mind.

5
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:16,940
When you're designing an interfce
you're playing, very much,

6
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:18,810
the role of an educator.

7
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:21,850
Your goal is to teach your
user how the system works

8
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:24,150
through the design of your interface.

9
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:26,930
But unlike a teacher,
you don't generally have the benefit of

10
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:30,440
being able to stand here and
explain things directly to your user.

11
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:33,081
Most users don't watch tutorials or
read documentation or if they do,

12
00:00:33,081 --> 00:00:34,770
they don't want to.

13
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:38,815
You have to design interfaces that
teach users while they're using them.

14
00:00:38,815 --> 00:00:40,865
That's where representations come in.

15
00:00:40,865 --> 00:00:45,225
Good representations show the user
exactly how the system actually works.

16
00:00:45,225 --> 00:00:46,925
It's an enormous challenge, but

17
00:00:46,925 --> 00:00:49,025
it's also incredibly satisfying
when you do it well.
