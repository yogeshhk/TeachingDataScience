00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:06,720
One of the challenges encountered by every new technology,

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:09,240
is helping the user understand how to use it.

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:11,570
Smart phone maybe pretty ubiquitous by now,

4
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:15,210
but we're still figuring out some elements of how to best use these things.

5
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:17,595
Typing efficiency on a touch screen for example

6
00:00:17,595 --> 00:00:20,385
still hasn't caught up to efficiency with a full keyboard.

7
00:00:20,385 --> 00:00:22,590
But that's because typing on a phone was also

8
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:25,830
a pretty straightforward transition from a regular keyboard,

9
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:29,490
because the on-screen keyboard was designed just as an analogy to the real one.

10
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:33,330
There are probably more efficient ways to enter text into a phone but it wouldn't be

11
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:37,630
as easily learnable as this straightforward analogy to a physical keyboard.

12
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:42,470
This illustrates both the positive and negative sides of using analogies in designs.

13
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:45,650
Analogies make the interface more learnable but they also may

14
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:49,285
restrict the interface to outdated requirements or constraints.

15
00:00:49,285 --> 00:00:54,170
So, take a moment and think about how this applies to your chosen area of HCI.

16
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:57,935
If you're looking at things like gestural interfaces or touch-based interfaces,

17
00:00:57,935 --> 00:01:02,335
what analogies can you draw to other interfaces to make your designs more learnable.

18
00:01:02,335 --> 00:01:06,620
And at the same time, what do you risk by using those analogies?
