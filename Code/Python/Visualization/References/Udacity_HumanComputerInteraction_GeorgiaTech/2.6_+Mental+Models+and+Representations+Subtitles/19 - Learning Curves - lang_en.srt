1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,320
Every interface requires the user to do some learning to understand how to use it.

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:07,200
Very often, we visualize this as a learning curve.

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,995
A learning curve plots expertise against experience.

4
00:00:10,995 --> 00:00:13,665
Generally, as the user gains more experience,

5
00:00:13,665 --> 00:00:15,210
they also gained more expertise.

6
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:18,000
Here, our user starts with no experience at all,

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,010
and so they also have no expertise at all.

8
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:24,494
Our goal is for them to end with an expertise above this line of proficiency.

9
00:00:24,494 --> 00:00:27,900
However, the shape and steepness of this curve can vary.

10
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:32,435
Ideally, we want a learning curve that grows quickly with relatively little experience.

11
00:00:32,435 --> 00:00:35,180
This is actually what we call a steep learning curve,

12
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:37,385
although usually when you hear steep learning curve,

13
00:00:37,385 --> 00:00:39,160
it means the exact opposite.

14
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:41,660
Technically, steep is good because steep means we're

15
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:44,765
increasing very quickly with relatively little experience.

16
00:00:44,765 --> 00:00:46,999
People often use steep to mean the opposite,

17
00:00:46,999 --> 00:00:50,870
and that's because steep calls to mind connotations of a high difficulty level,

18
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:52,690
like climbing a steep mountain.

19
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:57,080
So, steep is actually a poor representation of this concept.

20
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:59,960
So, instead, lets for us call this a rapid learning curve,

21
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:03,765
which means that expertise grows very quickly with relatively little experience.

22
00:01:03,765 --> 00:01:05,600
Rapid calls to mind probably the proper

23
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,630
connotations that a rapid learning curve is rapid learning,

24
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:10,535
which is probably something we want.

25
00:01:10,535 --> 00:01:14,935
Interfaces that are more difficult to use would have slower learning curves.

26
00:01:14,935 --> 00:01:19,369
Here, the user needs a lot more experience to reach the same level of proficiency.

27
00:01:19,369 --> 00:01:22,370
So, how do we help our user reach proficiency faster?

28
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:24,080
For one, if we're consistent with

29
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,250
existing conventions and use analogies that users understand,

30
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:30,980
we can actually start them off with effectively some initial expertise.

31
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:33,245
For example, when you download a new smartphone app,

32
00:01:33,245 --> 00:01:35,510
you know that the three horizontal lines that often appear

33
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:37,890
in the top right likely indicate a menu.

34
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:40,855
That's a consistent convention used across multiple apps.

35
00:01:40,855 --> 00:01:43,505
So, using it means that when users open your app,

36
00:01:43,505 --> 00:01:45,530
they already have some expertise.

37
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:49,010
From there, we want to make the ascension as rapid as possible.

38
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:52,400
One way we can do that is by using representations and affordances

39
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:55,910
that help the user immediately understand how to use the interface.

40
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:58,370
So, good design is in part about helping

41
00:01:58,370 --> 00:02:01,060
users achieve proficiency as quickly as possible,

42
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:04,280
either through starting them off with some initial expertise or helping

43
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:07,680
them grow in their expertise with as little experience as possible.
