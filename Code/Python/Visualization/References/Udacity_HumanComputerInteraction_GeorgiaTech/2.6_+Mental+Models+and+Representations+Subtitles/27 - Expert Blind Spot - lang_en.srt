00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:02,760
Generally, when we're
developing interfaces,

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:05,200
we're going to be experts
in those domains.

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:08,020
It's rare that you design an interface
to help people do something that you

4
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:09,990
yourself don't know how to do.

5
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:13,820
But as a result, there's risk for
something called expert blind spot.

6
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:16,580
When you're an expert in something,
there are parts of the task that you do

7
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:19,280
subconsciously without even
really thinking about them.

8
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:22,440
For example, a professional basketball
player knows exactly where to place

9
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:24,650
their hands on the ball
when taking a shot.

10
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:26,860
I know exactly what to do
when I walk in the studio.

11
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:29,900
Amanda knows exactly what to do
when she gets behind the camera.

12
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:33,130
And yet, if we were suddenly
asked to train someone else,

13
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:34,790
there are lots of things
we'd forget to say or

14
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:37,670
lots of things we would
assume would just be obvious.

15
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:40,450
That's exactly what you're doing
when you're designing an interface.

16
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:43,670
You're teaching the user how
to use what you've designed.

17
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:46,480
You're teaching them without the benefit
of actually talking to them,

18
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,370
explaining things to them, or
demonstrating things for them.

19
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:51,444
You're teaching them through
the design of the interface.

20
00:00:51,444 --> 00:00:56,000
So, you have to make sure that you don't
assume that they're an expert too.

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,640
You have to overcome that expert blind
spot because we are not our users.

22
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,590
We are not the user.

23
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:04,815
That can be the motto of all of HCI.

24
00:01:04,815 --> 00:01:06,680
I am not my user.

25
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:09,768
Say it with me, I am not my user.

26
00:01:09,768 --> 00:01:13,020
One more time, I am not my user.

27
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:13,930
Now type it.
