1
00:00:00,235 --> 00:00:03,070
Norman also divides mistakes in
the multiple categories, in this case,

2
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:04,500
three categories.

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:10,650
Rule based mistakes, knowledge base
mistakes and memory lapse mistakes.

4
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:13,600
Rule based mistakes occur where
the user correctly assesses the state

5
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:17,090
of the world but
makes the wrong decision based on it.

6
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:20,900
Knowledge based mistakes occur where the
user incorrectly assesses the state of

7
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:22,610
the world in the first place.

8
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:25,580
Memory lapse mistakes are similar
to memory lapse slips, but

9
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,880
this focuses on forgetting
to fully execute a plan

10
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,190
not just forgetting to do
something in the first place.

11
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:33,540
If the user clicks the wrong
button in this dialog,

12
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:36,220
it could be do to multiple
different kinds of mistakes.

13
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:39,120
Maybe they correctly knew they
wanted to save their changes but

14
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,300
they didn't realize that clicking
no is actually what would save,

15
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:44,430
that would be a rule-based mistake.

16
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:45,500
They knew they wanted to save,

17
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:48,660
but they made the wrong decision
based on that knowledge.

18
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:51,270
Or perhaps they didn't even realize
they wanted to save in the first place.

19
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:54,490
Maybe they didn't think they made any
changes, when in actuality they did.

20
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:56,570
That would be a knowledge based mistake.

21
00:00:56,570 --> 00:00:59,050
They applied the right rule
based on their knowledge but

22
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:00,640
their knowledge was inaccurate.

23
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,540
If they were to shut down their computer
and never come back and answer this

24
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:07,250
dialogue in the first place, that might
be considered a memory lapse mistake.

25
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:10,740
They didn't fully execute the plan
of closing down the application.

26
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:13,610
So in our designs,
we want to do everything we can

27
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:16,020
to prevent all these
different kinds of errors.

28
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:20,060
We want to help prevent routine errors
by leveraging consistent practices

29
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:22,730
like designing dialogues
the way users are used to.

30
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:26,190
We also want to let our interface off
load some of the demands on working

31
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:30,650
memory from the user to the computer
to avoid memory lapse errors.

32
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:33,675
And we want the leverage good
representations to help users develop

33
00:01:33,675 --> 00:01:36,383
the right mental of models to
minimize these rule-based and

34
00:01:36,383 --> 00:01:37,980
knowledge-based errors.

35
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:40,720
And while errors are inevitable,
we should make sure to leverage

36
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:44,440
the tolerance principle to make sure
the repercussions can never be too bad.
