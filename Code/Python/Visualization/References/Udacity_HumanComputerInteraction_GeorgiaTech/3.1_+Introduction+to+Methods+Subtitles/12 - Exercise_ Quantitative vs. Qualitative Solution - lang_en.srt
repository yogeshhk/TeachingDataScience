1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:01,819
Quantitative data is numeric.

2
00:00:01,819 --> 00:00:04,550
Any of these things that can
be measured numerically,

3
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:06,800
really qualify as quantitative data.

4
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:09,200
Many of these things are things
that we can just count.

5
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,850
We count the number of students
mentioning office hours.

6
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:13,840
We count the number of participants.

7
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:16,580
Here we basically count the number of
students that completed the survey and

8
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:19,100
divided by all
the students in the class.

9
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:21,710
And here we have them count how
many hours per week they think

10
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:23,100
they spend in the course.

11
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,360
The first option can be
a little bit tricky.

12
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:28,993
On a scale of one to five in a numeric
scale, but because students have to

13
00:00:28,993 --> 00:00:33,130
choose one, two, three, four or five,
it's not a continuous numeric scale.

14
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:35,766
For example, we have no way of
guaranteeing the student sees

15
00:00:35,766 --> 00:00:37,266
the difference between a three and

16
00:00:37,266 --> 00:00:39,920
a four as the same as the difference
between a four and a five.

17
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,600
The types of analysis we can do on the
first kind of data, are more limited.

18
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,890
But nonetheless it's still
is measured numerically, so

19
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:47,310
it still is quantitative data.
