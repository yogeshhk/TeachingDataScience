1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:01,524
I encountered this in my first job,
actually.

2
00:00:01,524 --> 00:00:04,819
Somewhere between my freshman and
sophomore years at Georgia Tech,

3
00:00:04,819 --> 00:00:09,000
I had a job as a user interface
designer for a local broadcast company.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,950
I designed an interface, then I handed
it over to a team of engineers for

5
00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:13,380
implementation.

6
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:16,548
Late in the process, the requirements
were changed a bit and new configuration

7
00:00:16,548 --> 00:00:19,251
screen was needed that the engineers
just went ahead and looked up.

8
00:00:19,251 --> 00:00:22,562
We got the finish tool and
it all worked beautifully and perfectly,

9
00:00:22,562 --> 00:00:24,547
except for this configuration screen.

10
00:00:24,547 --> 00:00:26,836
It was a list of over
50 different settings,

11
00:00:26,836 --> 00:00:29,018
each with 3 to 5 radio
buttons to the side.

12
00:00:29,018 --> 00:00:30,652
Each setting was a different length.

13
00:00:30,652 --> 00:00:32,313
Each radio button label
was a different length.

14
00:00:32,313 --> 00:00:34,548
There was kind of placed
all over the campus.

15
00:00:34,548 --> 00:00:35,284
There was no grid.

16
00:00:35,284 --> 00:00:36,396
It was illegible.

17
00:00:36,396 --> 00:00:40,170
It was unusable, but
it was technically functional.

18
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:43,420
It met the requirements described in
terms of what the user must be able to

19
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:46,390
do, just not how usable it was.

20
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:48,860
Fortunately, there's a greater
appreciation of the value of

21
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:51,420
user-centered design now
than there was then.

22
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:52,730
So, many spaces have become so

23
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:56,480
crowded that the user experience is
what can really set a company apart.

24
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,856
I've actually been noticing a trend
lately toward new user experiences

25
00:00:59,856 --> 00:01:01,079
around really old tasks.

26
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:04,640
I use an app called stash to buy and
sell small amounts of mutual funds.

27
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,548
Buying mutual funds has
been around forever and

28
00:01:06,548 --> 00:01:08,847
E-Trade has even been doing
that online for a long time.

29
00:01:08,847 --> 00:01:12,455
What differentiates stash
is the new user experience.

30
00:01:12,455 --> 00:01:15,930
Automated investing, simple tracking,
simplified summaries.

31
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:19,899
User experience design really has
become a major differentiator between

32
00:01:19,899 --> 00:01:21,120
success and failure.
