1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:02,740
You might actually come from a software
engineering background, and so

2
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:05,570
while user-centric designs
sounds obvious to some people,

3
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:08,020
you might have experienced
the other side of the coin.

4
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:09,480
In many industries and domains,

5
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:13,200
software engineers are still left to
design user interfaces themselves.

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,690
There's a fantastic book about this
called The Inmates Are Running

7
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:17,530
the Asylum, by Alan Cooper.

8
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:21,040
Where he compares technology
to a dancing bear at a circus.

9
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:22,700
He notes that people marvel
at the dancing bear,

10
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:26,240
not because it's good at dancing,
but because it dances at all.

11
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:29,100
The same way, people marvel at
certain pieces of technology not

12
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:32,520
because they work well, but
because they work at all.

13
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:35,830
The book was released in 2004 and
since then the user has become more and

14
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:37,780
more a focal point of design.

15
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:40,720
And yet there is still places where
individuals with little ACI background

16
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:44,550
are designing user-facing interfaces for
one reason or another.

17
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:47,300
Since it's a stronger chance you've
worked in software engineering,

18
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:48,770
reflect on that a bit.

19
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:51,310
Have you seen places where software
engineers, data scientists, or

20
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:55,420
even non-technical people were put in
charge of designing user interfaces?

21
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:55,940
How did it go?
