1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,170
There is one final distinction we
need to understand going forward

2
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:06,730
because it's going to come up at
every stage of the design lifecycle,

3
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:09,580
qualitative versus quantitative data.

4
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:11,150
At every stage of the design lifecycle,

5
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:13,860
we're interested in
gathering data from users.

6
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:15,633
Early on that might be
descriptions of what they do

7
00:00:15,633 --> 00:00:17,078
when they're interacting with a task.

8
00:00:17,078 --> 00:00:20,555
Or it might be measures of how long
certain tasks take to complete,

9
00:00:20,555 --> 00:00:24,030
or how many people judge
a task to be difficult.

10
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:27,590
Later on, though, it might be whether or
not users prefer our new interfaces or

11
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:30,390
how much better they
perform on certain tasks.

12
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:33,794
Now data will always fall into one
of two categories, qualitative and

13
00:00:33,794 --> 00:00:34,607
quantitative.

14
00:00:34,607 --> 00:00:37,689
Quantitative is probably
the easier one to describe,

15
00:00:37,689 --> 00:00:40,505
quantitative data
describes anything numeric.

16
00:00:40,505 --> 00:00:44,205
When data is summarized numerically,
we can perform statistical tests and

17
00:00:44,205 --> 00:00:46,574
summaries on it,
draw formal conclusions, and

18
00:00:46,574 --> 00:00:48,100
make objective comparisons.

19
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:51,380
Now there are a lot of strengths
of quantitative data, but

20
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:53,990
those strengths come in large part
because quantitative data only

21
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:58,060
captures a narrow view of what we
might be interested in examining.

22
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:01,202
It's very strong for
a very small class of things.

23
00:01:01,202 --> 00:01:04,733
Qualitative data covers
pretty much everything else.

24
00:01:04,733 --> 00:01:08,050
Qualitative Data covers descriptions,
accounts, observations,

25
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:10,240
it's often in natural language.

26
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:13,630
It could be open ended survey responses,
or interview transcripts, or

27
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:15,620
bug reports or
just your personal observations.

28
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:20,270
Because of its flexibility, qualitative
data gives us a much broader and

29
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:22,760
more general picture of
what we're examining.

30
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:25,960
But the cost is that it's hard to
generate formal conclusions based on

31
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,540
qualitative data.

32
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:30,580
Qualitative data may be
more prone to biases.

33
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:31,790
Now in some circumstances,

34
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:35,560
we can convert qualitative
data into quantitative data.

35
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,080
For example,

36
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:39,360
we could count the number of surveys
respondents to an end of course survey

37
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,325
who mentioned course difficulty
in their free response questions.

38
00:01:42,325 --> 00:01:45,470
Now the free response question
would be qualitative data but

39
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:49,220
numerically summarizing it
generates quantitative data.

40
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:50,990
Generally speaking, though,
quantitative data and

41
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:54,580
qualitative data serve different
purposes in a design life cycle.

42
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:57,781
I've heard it described quantitative
data provides the what,

43
00:01:57,781 --> 00:02:00,282
the qualitative data provides the how or
the why.

44
00:02:00,282 --> 00:02:03,194
When performing need finding or
when doing some initial prototype

45
00:02:03,194 --> 00:02:07,042
evaluations, we're likely interested in
users' qualitative descriptions of their

46
00:02:07,042 --> 00:02:09,174
tasks or
their experiences with the interface.

47
00:02:09,174 --> 00:02:12,386
It's generally only after a few
iterations that we start to be

48
00:02:12,386 --> 00:02:17,470
interested in quantitative analysis,
to find numeric improvements or changes.

49
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:20,340
We can also use these in conjunction
with one another, collecting both

50
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:24,230
quantitative and qualitative
data from the same participants.

51
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:27,910
That's referred to as a mixed method
approach, it's a mix of qualitative and

52
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:31,190
quantitative data to paint a more
complete picture of the results.
