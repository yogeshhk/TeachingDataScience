1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:03,880
At every stage of this design life
cycle, we're interested in gathering

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:07,350
information from the user to
better inform our designs.

3
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:10,960
To do that, we need a number of methods
to actually obtain that information.

4
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,840
Fortunately, there are a number of
methods we can employ to try to gather

5
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:15,590
the information we need.

6
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:16,285
And in fact,

7
00:00:16,285 --> 00:00:20,780
the majority of this unit will go
through all these different methods.

8
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:22,780
These will become
the tools in your toolbox.

9
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:26,810
Things you can call upon to grab the
information you need when you need it.

10
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:29,970
Not the many of this method are so
well-developed that you can cover them

11
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:32,610
in the entire units,
or even entire courses.

12
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:34,185
For example, we'll spend about three or

13
00:00:34,185 --> 00:00:36,354
four minutes talking about
naturalistic observation.

14
00:00:36,354 --> 00:00:38,224
And yet, there are entire textbooks and

15
00:00:38,224 --> 00:00:41,770
courses on how to do naturalistic
observation really well.

16
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:45,380
The goal of this is to give you
enough information to get started and

17
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:47,450
enough to know what you
need to explore next.

18
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:51,960
Remember, one of the original goals of
this class was not just to understand

19
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:57,050
more HCI but also to understand how
big the field of HCI actually is.
