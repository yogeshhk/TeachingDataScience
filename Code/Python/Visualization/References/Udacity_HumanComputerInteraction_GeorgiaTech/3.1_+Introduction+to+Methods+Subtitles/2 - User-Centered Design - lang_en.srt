00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
User-centered design is design that considers the needs

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:05,295
of the user throughout the entire design process.

3
00:00:05,295 --> 00:00:08,505
As far as we're concerned, that's pretty much just good design.

4
00:00:08,505 --> 00:00:11,010
But oftentimes, that isn't the way design is done.

5
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:12,420
Design has often done to meet

6
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:16,320
some functional specification of what the tool must technically be able to accomplish,

7
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,765
instead of considering the real needs of the user.

8
00:00:18,765 --> 00:00:22,440
Or sometimes people will go through an entire design process,

9
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:26,250
believing they understand the needs of the user without ever really checking.

10
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:29,580
User-centered design is about prioritizing the user's needs,

11
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:32,625
while also recognizing that we don't know the user's needs.

12
00:00:32,625 --> 00:00:35,880
So, we need to involve them at every stage of the process.

13
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:38,895
Before we start, we need to examine the user's needs in depth

14
00:00:38,895 --> 00:00:42,075
both by observing them and by asking them direct questions.

15
00:00:42,075 --> 00:00:43,590
After we start designing,

16
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:47,350
we need to present our design alternatives and prototypes to the user to get feedback.

17
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:49,180
When we near a design that we like,

18
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:52,745
we need to evaluate the quality of the design with real users.

19
00:00:52,745 --> 00:00:57,080
Having a good working knowledge of HCI principles helps us go through this more quickly,

20
00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:01,190
but we can't design great interfaces just by applying guidelines and heuristics alone.

21
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:02,915
We have to interact with our users,

22
00:01:02,915 --> 00:01:06,410
understand their needs, and involve them in the evaluation.
