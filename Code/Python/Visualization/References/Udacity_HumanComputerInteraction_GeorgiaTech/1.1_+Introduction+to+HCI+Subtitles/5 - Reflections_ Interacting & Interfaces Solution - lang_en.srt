00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:03,390
Video games actually give us some
great examples of interfaces

2
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:04,800
becoming invisible.

3
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:07,570
A good video game is really
characterized by the player feeling like

4
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:09,300
they're actually inside the game world,

5
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:12,590
as opposed to controlling it by
pressing some buttons on a controller.

6
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:15,880
We can do that through some
intuitive controller design like

7
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:18,580
pressing forward moves forward, and
pressing backward moves backwards.

8
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:21,710
But a lot of times we'll rely on
the user to also learn how to control

9
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:22,500
the game over time.

10
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:26,410
But as they learn, it becomes invisible
between them and their interaction.

11
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:29,830
A classic example of a place where
interaction is more visible,

12
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:33,030
is the idea of having more than one
remote control that controls what

13
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:34,510
feels like the same system.

14
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:38,770
So I have these two controllers that
control my TV and my cable box together.

15
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:41,350
And for me it feels like this
is just one task, watching TV.

16
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:44,450
But technologically,
it's actually different tasks.

17
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:47,047
So I have to think about am I using
the number pad on this controller or

18
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:49,870
this controller, depending on what
I'm trying to do at a given time.

19
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:52,632
So I spend a lot of time
thinking about the interface and

20
00:00:52,632 --> 00:00:54,500
not as much thinking about the task.
