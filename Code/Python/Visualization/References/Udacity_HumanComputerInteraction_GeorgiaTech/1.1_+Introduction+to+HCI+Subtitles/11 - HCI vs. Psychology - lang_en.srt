1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:05,610
The research side of HCI connects to the
relationship between HCI and psychology.

2
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:09,160
And if we zoom out even further
on this hierarchy of disciplines,

3
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:11,940
we might say that human
factors engineering itself

4
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:15,510
is in many ways the merger of
engineering and psychology.

5
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:18,140
As well as other fields of design and
cognitive science.

6
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:24,363
In HCI, the engineering side takes
the form of software engineering, but

7
00:00:24,363 --> 00:00:28,340
this connection to psychology remains,
and in fact, it's symbiotic.

8
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:32,200
We use our understanding of psychology,
of human perception,

9
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:36,050
of cognition to inform
the way we design interfaces.

10
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:39,610
We then use our evaluations of
those interfaces to reflect

11
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:42,110
on our understanding
of psychology itself.

12
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:45,560
In fact, at Georgia Tech, the Human
Computer Interaction class is cross

13
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:48,690
listed as a Computer Science and
Psychology class.

14
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:50,608
So let's take an example of this.

15
00:00:50,608 --> 00:00:54,155
In 1992, psychologists working
at Apple wanted to study

16
00:00:54,155 --> 00:00:58,410
how people organized the rapid flow
of information in their work spaces.

17
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:01,800
They observed that people tended
to form piles of related material,

18
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:05,170
kind of like a less formal
filing system, and so

19
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:09,030
they then designed a computer interface,
that would mimic that ability.

20
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:12,250
Finally, they used the results of that
development to reflect on how people

21
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:14,130
were managing their work
spaces in the first place.

22
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:18,550
So in the end, they had a better
understanding of the thought processes

23
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:22,880
of their users as well as an interface
that actually helped users.

24
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,250
So in the end,
their design of an interface with an HCI

25
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:29,710
informed their understanding
of psychology more generally.

26
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:32,860
We came away with a better understanding
of the way humans think about their work

27
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:36,180
spaces because of our
experience designing something

28
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:38,820
that was supposed to help them
think about their work spaces.
