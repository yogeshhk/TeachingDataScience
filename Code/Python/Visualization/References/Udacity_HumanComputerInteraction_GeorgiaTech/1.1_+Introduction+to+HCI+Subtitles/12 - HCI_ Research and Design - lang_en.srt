00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,345
Now that we've talked at length about what HCI isn't,

2
00:00:03,345 --> 00:00:06,780
let's talk a little bit about what HCI actually is.

3
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:10,484
On the one hand, HCI is about research.

4
00:00:10,484 --> 00:00:13,980
Many of the methods we'll discuss are about researching the user,

5
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:15,930
understanding their needs and evaluating

6
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:18,765
their interactions with designs that we prototype for them.

7
00:00:18,765 --> 00:00:21,510
But on the other hand, HCI is about design.

8
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:23,850
After all, design is that prototyping phase,

9
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:26,595
even though we're prototyping with research in mind.

10
00:00:26,595 --> 00:00:31,125
HCI is about designing interactions to help humans interact with computers,

11
00:00:31,125 --> 00:00:34,035
oftentimes using some known principles for good interaction,

12
00:00:34,035 --> 00:00:37,260
things like designing with distributed cognition in mind or making sure

13
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:40,650
the user develops good mental models of the way the interface works,

14
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:44,000
or making sure to design with universal design in mind.

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,950
We'll talk about all these topics later in our conversations.

16
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:50,000
You don't need to worry about understanding any of these right now.

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,550
What is important to understand right now,

18
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:55,525
is that these aren't two isolated sides.

19
00:00:55,525 --> 00:00:58,670
The results of our user research inform the designs we

20
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:03,620
construct and the results of our designs inform our ongoing research.

21
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:06,110
Again, you might notice this is very similar to

22
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:08,900
the feedback cycles we're designing for our users.

23
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:12,365
They use what they know to participate in the task,

24
00:01:12,365 --> 00:01:16,670
and then use the feedback from that participation to inform what they know.

25
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:19,550
We use what we know to design good interfaces,

26
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:24,190
and then use the results of those interfaces to inform our ongoing research.

27
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:28,625
This is the heart of what HCI is for the purpose of our conversations;

28
00:01:28,625 --> 00:01:31,880
using research to inform our designs and using

29
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:35,740
the results of those designs to inform our ongoing research.

30
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:40,640
In this cycle, appears anywhere that humans are using computers to participate in tasks.

31
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,055
That can be sitting at a desk using a screen.

32
00:01:43,055 --> 00:01:45,905
That could be using a smartphone or a smartwatch.

33
00:01:45,905 --> 00:01:49,715
That can be participating with some kind of touch or gesture-based system,

34
00:01:49,715 --> 00:01:54,275
or it could be some interesting emerging technologies like virtual and augmented reality.

35
00:01:54,275 --> 00:01:57,230
In HCI, we're interested in the general principles and

36
00:01:57,230 --> 00:02:01,430
methods for designing and researching all of these things.
