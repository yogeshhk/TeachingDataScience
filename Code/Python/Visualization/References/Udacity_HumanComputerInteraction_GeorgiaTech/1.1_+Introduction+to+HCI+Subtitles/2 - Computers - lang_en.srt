1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:02,110
This is a computer.

2
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:04,120
Or at least,
this is probably what you think of

3
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:05,810
when you think of the term computer.

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:07,960
But this is also a computer.

5
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:12,603
And so is this.

6
00:00:12,603 --> 00:00:13,105
And so is this.

7
00:00:13,105 --> 00:00:13,610
And so is this.

8
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:14,290
And so is this.

9
00:00:15,801 --> 00:00:17,960
>> Hey!

10
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:19,740
>> This is Amanda, my video producer.

11
00:00:21,655 --> 00:00:23,170
>> Go on, I'm rolling.

12
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:24,830
>> Right, and so is this.

13
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:30,580
And so is this, and this, and
this, and this, and even this.

14
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:31,780
And so is this.

15
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:33,008
And so is this.

16
00:00:33,008 --> 00:00:34,724
And so is this.

17
00:00:34,724 --> 00:00:35,629
[SOUND] And so is this.

18
00:00:35,629 --> 00:00:36,392
And so is this.

19
00:00:39,612 --> 00:00:41,230
Hey David?

20
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:42,640
>> One second,
trying to get to Squirtle.

21
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:46,220
There we go.

22
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:48,390
With mobile devices and

23
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:52,310
augmented reality,
HCI is quite literally everything.

24
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:54,920
Pokemon Go was released a few
days before I recorded this and

25
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:58,160
augmented reality games like this
turn effectively the entire world

26
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,880
into an instance of HCI.

27
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,540
Even out here in the middle of nowhere,

28
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:03,100
I'm still doing
something with computers.
