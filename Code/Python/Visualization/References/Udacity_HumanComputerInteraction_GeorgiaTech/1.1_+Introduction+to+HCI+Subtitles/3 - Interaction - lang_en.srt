1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:03,130
We have humans and we have computers and

2
00:00:03,130 --> 00:00:05,780
we're interested in
the interaction between them.

3
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:07,970
That interaction can take
different forms though.

4
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:11,780
The most obvious seems to be the human
interacts with the computer and

5
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:14,740
the computer interacts with
the human in response.

6
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:18,620
They go back and forth interacting,
and that's a valid view.

7
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:22,450
But it perhaps misses the more
interesting part of HCI.

8
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:26,670
We can also think of the human
interacting with the task,

9
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:28,180
through the computer.

10
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:31,570
The interaction is really between
the human and the task and

11
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:34,690
the computer in the middle just
mediates that interaction.

12
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:36,970
Or to put this differently,
the human and

13
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:40,140
the computer together,
interact with the task.

14
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:45,320
Ideally in this case, we're
interested in making the interface as

15
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:49,190
invisible as possible, so the user
can spend as little time focusing on

16
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:53,920
the interface and instead focus on the
tasks that they're trying to accomplish.

17
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,880
Realistically, our interfaces
are likely to stay somewhat visible.

18
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:01,590
But our goal is to let the user spend
as much time as possible thinking about

19
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:04,860
the task,
instead of thinking about our interface.

20
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:07,530
We can all probably remember times
when we've interacted with a piece of

21
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:08,850
software and

22
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:12,580
we felt like we spent all our time
thinking about how to work the software.

23
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:15,330
As opposed to accomplishing what we
were using the software to do in

24
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:17,840
the first place and that's frustrating.

25
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,500
So our goal as designers,

26
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:23,050
is to help the human feel like they're
interacting directly with that task.

27
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:26,930
While our interface, kind of vanishes,
in the middle of that interaction.
