1
00:00:00,193 --> 00:00:03,825
Now, what we've described so
far is a huge field,

2
00:00:03,825 --> 00:00:06,451
far too big to cover in any one class.

3
00:00:06,451 --> 00:00:10,007
In fact there are lots of places where
you can get an entire masters degree or

4
00:00:10,007 --> 00:00:11,764
PhD in human computer interaction.

5
00:00:11,764 --> 00:00:14,345
Here are some of the schools
that offer programs like that.

6
00:00:14,345 --> 00:00:18,066
And these are just the school that
offer actual degree programs in HCI,

7
00:00:18,066 --> 00:00:21,231
not computer science degrees
with specializations in HCI,

8
00:00:21,231 --> 00:00:24,039
which would be almost any
computer science program.

9
00:00:24,039 --> 00:00:26,768
So let's look more closely at
what we're interested in for

10
00:00:26,768 --> 00:00:28,577
the purpose of the next several weeks.

11
00:00:28,577 --> 00:00:33,582
To do that, let's look at where HCI
sits in a broader hierarchy of fields.

12
00:00:33,582 --> 00:00:37,984
We can think of HCI as a subset of
a broader field of human factors

13
00:00:37,984 --> 00:00:39,071
engineering.

14
00:00:39,071 --> 00:00:42,503
Human factors engineering is interested
in a lot of the same ideas that

15
00:00:42,503 --> 00:00:43,675
we're interested in.

16
00:00:43,675 --> 00:00:46,706
But they aren't just
interested in computers.

17
00:00:46,706 --> 00:00:49,864
Then there are also sub
disciplines within HCI.

18
00:00:49,864 --> 00:00:51,815
This is just one way to represent this.

19
00:00:51,815 --> 00:00:56,269
Some people, for example, would put UI
design under UX design, or put UX design

20
00:00:56,269 --> 00:00:59,950
on the same level as HCI, but
this is the way I choose to present it.

21
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:03,316
Generally, these use many of the same
principles that we use in HCI,

22
00:01:03,316 --> 00:01:05,868
but they might apply them
to a more narrow domain, or

23
00:01:05,868 --> 00:01:07,841
they might have their own principles and

24
00:01:07,841 --> 00:01:11,405
methods that they use in addition to
what we talk about in HCI in general.

25
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:14,430
So to get a feel for what we're
talking about when we discuss HCI,

26
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:16,860
let's compare it to these
other different fields.
