1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,510
Of the remaining fields the only
one we're likely interested in is

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:05,420
the data management questions.

3
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:08,074
The majority of the others cover
either clinical research or

4
00:00:08,074 --> 00:00:10,690
biological research or
other things that we

5
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:13,320
hopefully won't touch on very much
in human computer interaction.

6
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:16,680
Unless the field has changed a lot by
the time you're listening to this.

7
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:19,490
Nonetheless though you should actually
peek into the items to make sure that

8
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:22,400
they don't apply to you if you're
filling out a protocol like this.

9
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:23,730
Under the Data Management section,

10
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:27,180
we'll want to describe how we
keep participants data safe.

11
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:30,160
That'll include descriptions
of the way we store it and

12
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,580
define information about participants.

13
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:35,200
And how we'll safeguard the data
itself through password protection or

14
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,030
encryption or anything like that.

15
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:39,200
Finally, there are always some
questions that we answer for

16
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,170
all studies even though they
generally won't apply to us.

17
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:45,050
Generally our studies won't
involve the Department of Defense,

18
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:47,140
generally they shouldn't
involve Radiation.

19
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:50,000
And one day I really kind of hope
they involve Nanotechnology but

20
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,830
we're probably not quite there yet.

21
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:54,090
So we'd mark no that there
is no DoD involvement.

22
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:58,174
Finally, at the bottom, there's a place
to upload some additional documents.

23
00:00:58,174 --> 00:01:01,869
This is where we would supply things
like an interview script, a survey,

24
00:01:01,869 --> 00:01:05,565
a recruitment script and other documents
that the IRB would want to see and

25
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:06,114
approve.

26
00:01:06,114 --> 00:01:09,757
When we're done, we can click Save and
Continue Application.

27
00:01:09,757 --> 00:01:13,040
On the next page, we can preview
everything on one flat screen,

28
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,100
and then check off at the end that
we have no conflicts of interest, or

29
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:19,000
report them, if we do.

30
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,290
Then we'll click Save & Continue again.

31
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:24,420
And for y'all, you would then submit
it to your primary investigator.

32
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:26,000
I am the primary investigator so

33
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,810
I see something a little bit different
here than what you would see.

34
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:32,340
After submission, we'll generally hear
back from IRB in about three weeks about

35
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:35,300
whether the study was accepted and
what changes need to be made if not.
