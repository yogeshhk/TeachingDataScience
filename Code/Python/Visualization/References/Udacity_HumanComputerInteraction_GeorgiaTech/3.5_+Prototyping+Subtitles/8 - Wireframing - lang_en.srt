00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,375
Paper prototyping involve drawing things simply on paper,

2
00:00:03,375 --> 00:00:05,730
and it can be really good for experimenting with overall layouts,

3
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:07,860
especially because it tends to be a lot easier

4
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:10,605
to revise and tweak those pretty naturally.

5
00:00:10,605 --> 00:00:12,270
After some feedback though,

6
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:15,345
you'll likely want to start formalizing your designs a little bit more.

7
00:00:15,345 --> 00:00:18,015
One way of doing this would be called wireframing.

8
00:00:18,015 --> 00:00:19,980
In wireframing, we use

9
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:23,580
some more detailed tools to mark up what an interface might look like.

10
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:28,500
For example, my paper prototype from earlier might become a wireframe like this.

11
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:31,890
This lets us experiment with some additional details like font size,

12
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:34,860
colors, and the challenges of screen real estate.

13
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:37,280
Now, there are lots of tools out there for wireframing that

14
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,890
come equipped with built-in common widgets and layouts.

15
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:44,510
But you can also do some rudimentary wireframing in something as simple as PowerPoint.

16
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:47,050
Google Drawings can be used the same way as well.

17
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:48,770
So, you don't need to get super fancy.

18
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:50,615
Although if you do a lot of wireframing,

19
00:00:50,615 --> 00:00:53,240
you're probably want to find a more streamlined tool.

20
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:58,240
Some of the more popular paid products include Balsamiq and Axure.

21
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:00,829
These are both targeted more at professionals

22
00:01:00,829 --> 00:01:03,410
working in user interface or user experience design,

23
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:06,385
especially on teams and collaborating with a lot of people.

24
00:01:06,385 --> 00:01:10,130
If you're familiar with the suites of tools from either Microsoft or Adobe,

25
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:13,890
then Visio or InDesign might also be great options for you to use,

26
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:16,940
because you're already somewhat familiar with those interfaces.

27
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:20,230
But you don't actually have to buy a tool to do good wireframing.

28
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:22,490
There exists some free to use tools out there as well,

29
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:25,700
like the pencil project and frame box.

30
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:28,915
Those are great to use, especially if you're just getting started.

31
00:01:28,915 --> 00:01:33,065
Of course., these are just the popular ones that I know about right now.

32
00:01:33,065 --> 00:01:35,960
There are almost certainly more out there that I'm not familiar with,

33
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:37,850
and more will surely come available.

34
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:41,045
So, check with your classmates or colleagues to see what they would recommend.

35
00:01:41,045 --> 00:01:43,970
I'm personally really excited to see what kind of prototyping options

36
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:47,120
emerge for areas like virtual reality and augmented reality,

37
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:50,490
where you can't really prototype on a 2D canvas like this.
