00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,960
Paper prototyping is great when we're designing flat interfaces for screens,

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:07,245
but what if you're designing a voice interface or a gesture interface?

3
00:00:07,245 --> 00:00:08,895
How do you prototype that?

4
00:00:08,895 --> 00:00:11,535
One way is called the Wizard of Oz prototyping.

5
00:00:11,535 --> 00:00:13,800
Wizard of Oz prototyping is named as a reference to

6
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:17,110
the famous scene from the classic movie by the same name.

7
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:21,420
Pay no attention to that man behind the curtain.

8
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:24,600
The idea here is that we, behind the curtain,

9
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,995
do the things that the interface would do once it's actually implemented.

10
00:00:27,995 --> 00:00:29,890
That way, we can test out the interactions that we plan

11
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:31,905
to design and see how well they'll work.

12
00:00:31,905 --> 00:00:35,150
So, I have Morgan and we're going to do a Wizard of Oz prototype for

13
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:38,870
an interface to allow exercisers to consume and take notes on audio books.

14
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:41,840
So, I'll start by briefly telling her how the interface would work.

15
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,550
So, this interface is run by voice commands,

16
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:44,855
I'll simulate it on my phone,

17
00:00:44,855 --> 00:00:46,870
and you'll say play to play the book,

18
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:48,285
pause to pause the book.

19
00:00:48,285 --> 00:00:50,650
You'll say note to enter a note-taking viewer,

20
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:51,950
it will transcribe what you say,

21
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:55,820
and bookmark to just drop a bookmark wherever you are but without pausing.

22
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:57,140
So, whenever you're ready.

23
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:58,250
Let's do it.

24
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:01,440
All wealth consists of desirable things,

25
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:01,830
Pause.

26
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:03,970
That is things with,

27
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:08,910
Play, Which satisfy human wants directly or indirectly,

28
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:13,540
Bookmark, But not all desirable things are recognized as wealth. The affection,

29
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:13,660
Note.

30
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:15,000
Of friends for in,

31
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,955
This book is so good.

32
00:01:17,955 --> 00:01:20,135
Oh, I just realized actually,

33
00:01:20,135 --> 00:01:22,320
I guess I need a way for you to stop the note when you're done.

34
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,610
So, say close note when you're done taking note.

35
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:28,115
Close note.

36
00:01:28,115 --> 00:01:31,150
All right, you can stop. Now, based on this prototype,

37
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:32,650
I can also ask for some feedback.

38
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:35,260
So, Morgan, do you think it should automatically start playing again

39
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:38,315
when you stop that bookmark or should it, what should it do?

40
00:01:38,315 --> 00:01:41,710
Well, okay. So, I think I'd actually like to start playing from five seconds

41
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:45,880
back because I imagine saying note is going to step over some of the content.

42
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:48,650
Yeah, that makes sense and we can go through this and quickly

43
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:51,650
test out different ideas for how the interaction might work.

44
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:55,474
In practice, Wizard of Oz Prototypes can actually get very complex.

45
00:01:55,474 --> 00:01:57,560
You can have entire programs that work by having

46
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:00,245
a person supply the requested input at the right time.

47
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:01,625
But as a concept,

48
00:02:01,625 --> 00:02:04,940
a Wizard of Oz Prototype is a prototype where the user can now interact

49
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:07,140
authentically with the system while

50
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:10,050
a human supplies functionality that hasn't yet been implemented.
