00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,885
Wire-framing is great for prototyping onscreen interfaces but,

2
00:00:03,885 --> 00:00:07,970
again, what if you're working on something more physical or 3-dimensional?

3
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:11,400
In that case, you might want to construct a physical prototype,

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:14,625
but let's be clear, it doesn't have to actually work.

5
00:00:14,625 --> 00:00:16,600
That's where a lot of designers get tripped up.

6
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,210
They think to get good feedback on

7
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:21,525
a design they have to have a working version, but you don't.

8
00:00:21,525 --> 00:00:25,080
There are lots of elements you can test without actually implementing anything.

9
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:27,180
So, let's go back to our example of designing

10
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:29,955
a way for exercisers to take notes on audio books.

11
00:00:29,955 --> 00:00:34,080
One of my alternatives might be a Bluetooth device that synchronizes with the phone,

12
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:36,030
with buttons for different interactions.

13
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:38,520
The individual will hold this while exercising and interact

14
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:41,185
by pressing different buttons for play or pause or take a note.

15
00:00:41,185 --> 00:00:44,765
I've prototyped this just by taking my car's key fob.

16
00:00:44,765 --> 00:00:48,175
We could just say that we pretend this button does this and that button does this.

17
00:00:48,175 --> 00:00:50,900
It's probably not the exact shape I want but it's pretty close.

18
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:53,360
It's probably about the same size and I can test

19
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,860
the general idea of pressing buttons while exercising with this.

20
00:00:56,860 --> 00:01:00,380
I can actually do a lot of testing with this I can tell Morgan how it works,

21
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:02,510
and watch carefully to see if the button she presses are

22
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:05,935
the right ones to evaluate the intuitiveness of the interface.

23
00:01:05,935 --> 00:01:10,070
Or I could just ask her to go running while holding it and give me feedback on whether or

24
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:14,210
not holding something physical like this in her hand throws off her routine at all.

25
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:17,290
I can do a lot of prototyping without a working version
