00:00:02,990 --> 00:00:07,199
In this lesson, we've talked about several methods for prototyping.

2
00:00:07,199 --> 00:00:09,810
Our goal is to employ a lot of methods to get

3
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:13,275
feedback rapidly,and iterate quickly on our designs.

4
00:00:13,275 --> 00:00:17,850
Through that process, we can work our way toward creating our ultimate interface.

5
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:20,310
The main goal of this prototyping process has been to

6
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:22,800
create designs we can evaluate with real users.

7
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,580
We're obviously not going to deploy a hand-drawn interface to real customers.

8
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:29,715
Its value is in its ability to get us feedback.

9
00:00:29,715 --> 00:00:33,509
That's what the entire design life cycle has been leading towards: evaluation,

10
00:00:33,509 --> 00:00:38,340
evaluating our ideas, evaluating our prototypes, evaluating our designs.

11
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:42,595
That user evaluation is the key to user-centered design.

12
00:00:42,595 --> 00:00:44,810
Focusing on user evaluation ensures that

13
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:47,935
our focus is always on the user's needs and experiences.

14
00:00:47,935 --> 00:00:50,795
So, now that we've researched users needs,

15
00:00:50,795 --> 00:00:52,505
brainstorm some design alternatives,

16
00:00:52,505 --> 00:00:54,440
and create some shareable prototypes,

17
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:57,260
let's move on to actual evaluation.
