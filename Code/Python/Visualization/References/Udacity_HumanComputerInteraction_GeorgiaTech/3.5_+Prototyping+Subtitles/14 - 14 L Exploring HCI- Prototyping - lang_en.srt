1
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:06,090
If you're working in an application area that relies

2
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:08,250
on traditional screens and input methods,

3
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:11,100
your prototyping process might be pretty straightforward.

4
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:13,410
It'll go from paper prototypes to wireframes

5
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:17,130
exploring iteratively more complete versions of the final interface.

6
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:19,125
For a lot of emerging domains though,

7
00:00:19,125 --> 00:00:21,645
you'll have to get somewhat creative with your prototyping.

8
00:00:21,645 --> 00:00:23,985
For things like gestural or voice interaction,

9
00:00:23,985 --> 00:00:27,090
you can likely use Wizard of Oz prototyping by having a human

10
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:31,080
interpret the actions or commands that will ultimately be interpreted by the computer.

11
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:33,720
For augmented reality or wearable devices though,

12
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:35,520
you might have to get even more creative.

13
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,455
So take a second and brainstorm how you might go about prototyping in your chosen field.

14
00:00:40,455 --> 00:00:44,735
Remember, your goal is to get feedback on your ideas from the user early.

15
00:00:44,735 --> 00:00:48,020
What can you create that will get you that feedback?
