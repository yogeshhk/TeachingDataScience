1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,730
In this lesson we've covered various
different methods for prototyping.

2
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:06,910
Each method has its advantages and
disadvantages.

3
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:10,684
So let's start to wrap up the lesson by
exploring this with another exercise.

4
00:00:10,684 --> 00:00:12,587
Here are the methods
that we've covered and

5
00:00:12,587 --> 00:00:14,920
here are some of
the potential advantages.

6
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:18,955
For each row, mark the column
to which that advantage applies.

7
00:00:18,955 --> 00:00:20,910
Note that as always,
these are somewhat relative,

8
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:22,950
so your answer might differ from ours.
