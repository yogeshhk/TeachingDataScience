2
00:00:05,926 --> 00:00:07,390
So we've talked to our users.

3
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:09,780
We've gathered some
understanding of what they need.

4
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:12,260
We've created some ideas for
how we might address their need and

5
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:15,580
we've mentally simulated
those different alternatives.

6
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:19,050
Now it's time to start actually making
things we can put in front of users.

7
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:21,585
[SOUND] This is the prototyping stage.

8
00:00:21,585 --> 00:00:25,015
Like brainstorming design alternatives,
this involves looking at the different

9
00:00:25,015 --> 00:00:27,600
ideas available to us and
developing them a bit.

10
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:30,170
But the major distinction
is that in prototyping,

11
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:33,350
we want to actually build things
we can put in front of users.

12
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:35,900
But that doesn't mean building
the entire interface before we

13
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:38,050
ever even have a user look at it.

14
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:41,740
We want to get user feedback as
quickly and rapidly as possible.

15
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:44,520
And build up more sophisticated
prototypes over time

16
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:47,000
as we go through the design life cycle.

17
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,668
So we'll start with low fidelity
prototypes, things that can be assembled

18
00:00:50,668 --> 00:00:53,429
and revised very quickly for
rapid feedback from users.

19
00:00:53,429 --> 00:00:57,273
Then we'll work our way towards higher
fidelity prototypes, like wire frames or

20
00:00:57,273 --> 00:00:59,010
working versions of our interface.
