1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:01,430
With qualitative research,

2
00:00:01,430 --> 00:00:04,210
we want to capture as much
of the session as possible.

3
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:05,950
Because things could come up
that we don't anticipate.

4
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:07,680
And we'd like to look
at them again later.

5
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:08,960
So how do we do that?

6
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,360
One way is to actually
record the session.

7
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:15,965
The pros of recording a session are that
it's automated, it's comprehensive, and

8
00:00:15,965 --> 00:00:17,155
it's passive.

9
00:00:17,155 --> 00:00:19,545
Automated means that it runs
automatically in the background.

10
00:00:19,545 --> 00:00:22,145
Comprehensive means that it
captures everything that happens

11
00:00:22,145 --> 00:00:23,085
during the session.

12
00:00:23,085 --> 00:00:26,755
And passive means that it lets us
focus on administering the session

13
00:00:26,755 --> 00:00:28,305
instead of capturing it.

14
00:00:28,305 --> 00:00:29,225
The cons though,

15
00:00:29,225 --> 00:00:33,235
are that it's intrusive, it's difficult
to analyze, and it's screenless.

16
00:00:33,235 --> 00:00:37,500
Intrusive means that many participants
are uncomfortable being videotaped.

17
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,590
It creates oppression knowing
that every question or

18
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:42,930
every mistake is going to captured and
analyzed by researchers later.

19
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:45,440
Video is also very difficult to analyze.

20
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,450
It requires a person to come later and

21
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:50,930
watch every minute of video, usually
several times, in order to code and

22
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:53,410
pull out what was actually
relevant in that session.

23
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:57,330
And video recording often has difficulty
capturing interactions on-screen.

24
00:00:57,330 --> 00:00:59,930
We can film what a person is doing
on a keyboard or with a mouse, but

25
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:03,460
it is difficult to then see how that
translates to on-screen actions.

26
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:05,400
Now some of these issues
can be resolved, of course.

27
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,935
We can do video capture on the screen
synchronize it with a video recording.

28
00:01:08,935 --> 00:01:11,785
But if we're dealing with children,
or at risk populations, or

29
00:01:11,785 --> 00:01:16,435
with some delicate subject matter,
the intrusiveness can be overwhelming.

30
00:01:16,435 --> 00:01:18,655
And if we want to do a lot
of complex sessions,

31
00:01:18,655 --> 00:01:21,965
the difficulty in analyzing that
data can also be overwhelming.

32
00:01:21,965 --> 00:01:24,815
For my dissertation work I captured
about 200 hours of video, and

33
00:01:24,815 --> 00:01:27,600
that's probably why it took
me an extra year to graduate.

34
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,990
It takes a lot of time to
go through all that video.

35
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:33,000
So instead we can also
focus on note-taking.

36
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,318
The benefits of note-taking are that
it's very cheap, it's not intrusive, and

37
00:01:37,318 --> 00:01:38,314
it is analyzable.

38
00:01:38,314 --> 00:01:41,403
It's cheap because we don't have to
buy expensive cameras or equipment,

39
00:01:41,403 --> 00:01:44,355
we just have our pens and papers or
our laptops, or anything like that.

40
00:01:44,355 --> 00:01:47,191
And can just do it using equipment
we already have available to us.

41
00:01:47,191 --> 00:01:51,210
It's not intrusive, in that it only
captures what we decide to capture.

42
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:54,460
If a participant is uncomfortable asking
questions or makes a silly mistake with

43
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:57,690
the interface, we don't necessarily
have to capture that, and that can make

44
00:01:57,690 --> 00:02:00,925
the participant feel a little bit
more comfortable being themselves.

45
00:02:00,925 --> 00:02:03,455
And it's a lot easier to analyze notes.

46
00:02:03,455 --> 00:02:04,275
You can scroll through and

47
00:02:04,275 --> 00:02:06,815
read the notes on a one hour
session in only a few minutes.

48
00:02:06,815 --> 00:02:09,685
But analyzing that same session in
video is certainly going to take at

49
00:02:09,685 --> 00:02:12,515
least an hour, if not more,
to watch it more than once.

50
00:02:12,515 --> 00:02:14,122
But but
of course there are draw backs too.

51
00:02:14,122 --> 00:02:16,732
Taking those can be a very slow process,
meaning that we

52
00:02:16,732 --> 00:02:19,612
can't keep up with the dynamic
interactions that we're evaluating.

53
00:02:19,612 --> 00:02:22,482
It's also manual which means that
we actually have to focus on

54
00:02:22,482 --> 00:02:25,832
actively taking notes, which gets in
the way of administering the session.

55
00:02:25,832 --> 00:02:27,103
If you're going to use note taking,

56
00:02:27,103 --> 00:02:29,281
you probably want to actually
have two people involved.

57
00:02:29,281 --> 00:02:32,511
One person running the session,
and one person taking notes.

58
00:02:32,511 --> 00:02:34,981
And finally,
it's limited in what it captures.

59
00:02:34,981 --> 00:02:36,561
It might not capture
some of the movements or

60
00:02:36,561 --> 00:02:39,700
the motions that a person does when
interacting with an interface.

61
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:41,960
It doesn't capture how long
they hesitate before deciding

62
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,270
what to do next.

63
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:45,070
We can write all that down of course,
but

64
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:48,490
we're going to run into the limitation
of how fast we can take notes.

65
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:51,460
It would be nearly impossible to
simultaneously take notes on what

66
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:54,630
questions the user is asking, how
long they're taking to do things, and

67
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:55,930
what kind of mistakes they're making.

68
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:59,210
Especially if we're also responsible for
administering the session at the same.

69
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:01,920
A third approach if we're
designing software,

70
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,030
is to actually log the behavior
inside the software.

71
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:07,920
This is in some ways,
the best of both worlds.

72
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,340
Like video capture,
it's automatic and passive, but

73
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:12,400
like note taking, it's analyzable.

74
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,700
Because it's run to the system itself,
it automatically captures everything

75
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:19,000
that it knows how to capture, and
it does so without our active invention.

76
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,780
But it likely does so in a data or

77
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:24,230
text format, that we can then either
analyze manually by reading through it,

78
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:27,580
or even with some more complicated
data analytics methods.

79
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:31,860
So in some ways, it captures the pros
from both note-taking and video capture.

80
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:33,690
But it also has its drawbacks as well.

81
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:35,820
Especially, it's very limited.

82
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:38,550
We can only capture those things
that are actually expressed

83
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:39,850
inside the software.

84
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:42,730
Things like the questions that
a participant asks wouldn't naturally be

85
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:44,390
captured by software logging.

86
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:47,820
Similarly, it only captures
a narrow slice of the interaction.

87
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:50,730
It only captures what the user
actually does on the screen.

88
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:53,100
It doesn't capture how long
they look at something.

89
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,620
We might be able to infer that
by looking at the time between

90
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:58,860
interactions, but it's difficult to
know if that hesitation was because they

91
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:00,310
couldn't decide what to do, or

92
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:03,450
because someone was making noise
outside, or something else was going on.

93
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:05,610
And finally,
it's also very tech sensitive.

94
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:07,830
We really have to have
a working prototype,

95
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:09,530
in order to use software logging.

96
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:12,420
But remember,
many of our prototypes dont' work yet.

97
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:15,730
You can't do software logging on a paper
prototype, or a card prototype, or

98
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:17,180
a Wizard of Oz prototype.

99
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:20,380
This only really works once we've
reached a certain level of fidelity with

100
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:21,600
our interfaces.

101
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,630
So in selecting a way to capture
your qualitative evaluation,

102
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:28,450
ask yourself, will the subjects find
being captured on camera intrusive?

103
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:30,690
Do I need to capture
what happens on screen?

104
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:33,120
How difficult will this
data be to analyze?

105
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,260
It's tempting, especially for

106
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:38,410
novices, to focus on just capturing as
much as possible during the session.

107
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:41,260
But during the session is when you can
capture data in a way that's going to

108
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:43,050
make your analysis easier.

109
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:45,070
So think about the analysis
that you want to do,

110
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:46,910
when deciding how to
capture your sessions.
