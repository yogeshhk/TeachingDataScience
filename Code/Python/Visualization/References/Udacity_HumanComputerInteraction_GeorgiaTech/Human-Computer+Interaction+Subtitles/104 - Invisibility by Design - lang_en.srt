1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,440
Our goal is to create interfaces that
are invisible from the moment the user

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:04,350
starts using them.

3
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:07,230
They should feel immediately as if
they're interacting with the task

4
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:09,080
underlying the interface.

5
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:10,910
Now this is an extremely tall order and

6
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:14,740
one we honestly probably won't meet
very often, but it's the goal.

7
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:16,100
In fact, in my opinion,

8
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:19,440
this is why people tend to
underestimate the complexity of HCI.

9
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:20,610
When you do things right,

10
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:23,100
people won't be aware that
you've done anything at all.

11
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:26,100
So how do we create interfaces that
are invisible from the very first moment

12
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:27,680
the user starts using them?

13
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:30,450
That's precisely what we'll discuss in
a lot of our conversations about HCI.

14
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:34,620
We'll talk about principles for
creating interfaces that disappear like

15
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:37,195
leveraging prior expectations and
providing quick feedback.

16
00:00:37,195 --> 00:00:40,130
We'll also talk a lot about how
to get inside the user's head and

17
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:42,860
understand what they're seeing when they
look at an interface that we can make

18
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:46,540
sure that they're internal
mental model matches the system.

19
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:50,420
In fact, if we consider invisibility
to be a hallmark of usable design,

20
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:53,700
then this entire course could be
retitled Creating Invisible Interfaces.
