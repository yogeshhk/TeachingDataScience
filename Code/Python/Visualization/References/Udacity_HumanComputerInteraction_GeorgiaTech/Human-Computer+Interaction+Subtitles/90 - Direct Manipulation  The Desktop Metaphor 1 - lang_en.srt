00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:02,510
Our goal is to narrow
the gulf of execution and

2
00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:05,240
the gulf of evaluation
as much as possible.

3
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:08,990
And arguably the ultimate form of this
is something called direct manipulation.

4
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:11,950
Now today direct manipulation is
a very common interaction style.

5
00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:16,190
But in the history of HCI it was
a revolutionary new approach.

6
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:19,730
Now to understand direct manipulation,
let's talk about the desktop metaphor.

7
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:23,060
The files and folders on your computer
are meant to mimic physical files and

8
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:24,570
folders on a desktop.

9
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:27,080
So, here are on my physical desktop,
I have some files.

10
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:28,250
What do I do if I want to move them?

11
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:32,659
Well, I pick them up and I move them.

12
00:00:32,659 --> 00:00:34,340
What do I do if I want
to put them in a folder?

13
00:00:35,515 --> 00:00:39,315
I pick them up and
put them in the folder.

14
00:00:39,315 --> 00:00:40,905
I'm physically moving the files from

15
00:00:40,905 --> 00:00:43,345
where they are to where
I want them to be.

16
00:00:43,345 --> 00:00:46,055
If files and folders on a computer
are meant to mimic files and

17
00:00:46,055 --> 00:00:49,225
folders on a physical desk, then
shouldn't the act of moving them also

18
00:00:49,225 --> 00:00:51,665
mimic the real world
action of moving them?

19
00:00:51,665 --> 00:00:55,715
Wouldn't it narrow the gulf execution to
leverage that real world experience and

20
00:00:55,715 --> 00:00:56,845
that real world expectation?
