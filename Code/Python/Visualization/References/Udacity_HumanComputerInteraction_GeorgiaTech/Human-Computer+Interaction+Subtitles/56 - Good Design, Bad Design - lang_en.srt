Good design,

3
00:00:04,153 --> 00:00:08,890
a GPS system that warns you 20 seconds
before you need to make a turn.

4
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:12,020
>> In 1,000 feet, turn left.

5
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:13,190
>> Bad design,

6
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:17,040
a GPS system that warns you two seconds
before you need to make a turn.

7
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:19,165
>> Turn left now, hurry.

>> It sounds funny, but which view you

9
00:00:24,154 --> 00:00:28,090
take on the user can have a huge impact
on the success of the interface.

10
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:31,890
If you view the user just as a sensory
processor, you might think that we only

11
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:34,790
need to alert them a second
before the upcoming turn because,

12
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:38,190
after all, human reaction
time is less than a second.

13
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:39,500
If you view the user as a predictor,

14
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:43,360
you understand they need time to slow
the car down and actually make the turn.

15
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,540
So they might need a few more seconds
to execute the action of turning

16
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:48,185
before being alerted they need to turn.

17
00:00:48,185 --> 00:00:52,130
And if you view the user as
a participant, you'll understand this is

18
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:55,500
happening while they're going 50 miles
down the road with a screaming toddler

19
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:58,140
in the backseat, trying to merge
with the driver on a cell phone and

20
00:00:58,140 --> 00:00:59,780
the other one eating a cheeseburger.

21
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:02,960
So it would probably be a good idea to
give them a few or more reminders before

22
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,519
the turn and plenty of time
to get in the right position.
