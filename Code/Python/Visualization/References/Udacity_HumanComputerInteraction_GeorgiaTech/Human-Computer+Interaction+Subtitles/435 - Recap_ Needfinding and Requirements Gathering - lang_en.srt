1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,680
The first stage of the design life cycle was need-finding.

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:07,950
Need-finding was how he developed a keen understanding of the needs of our users.

3
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:11,370
One of the biggest mistakes a designer can make is assuming they already

4
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:15,390
understand the user and the task before ever interacting with them.

5
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:17,790
There are several questions about the user we need to

6
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:19,800
answer before we're ready to start designing.

7
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,920
So, to get a good understanding of the user and the task,

8
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,730
we discuss several methods.

9
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:27,980
We might start with methods that have little direct interaction with the users,

10
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:31,415
like watching them in the wild or trying out the task ourselves.

11
00:00:31,415 --> 00:00:33,140
We might use those to inform

12
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:37,975
some more targeted need-finding exercises like interviews and focus groups and surveys.

13
00:00:37,975 --> 00:00:40,790
By combining multiple need-finding approaches,

14
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:43,010
we can build a strong model of the user and

15
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:46,420
the task that will help us design usable interfaces.
