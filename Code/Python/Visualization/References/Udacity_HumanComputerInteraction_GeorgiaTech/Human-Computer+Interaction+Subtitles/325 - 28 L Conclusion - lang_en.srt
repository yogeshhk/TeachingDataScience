00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:05,865
Today, we've talked about needfinding.

2
00:00:05,865 --> 00:00:10,560
Needfinding is how you develop your understanding of the needs of your user,

3
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:12,375
what tasks are they completing,

4
00:00:12,375 --> 00:00:15,180
what is the context of those tasks, what else is going on,

5
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:17,250
what are they thinking during the task,

6
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:19,620
and what did they have to hold in working memory.

7
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:23,865
All these things feed into your understanding of your users' needs.

8
00:00:23,865 --> 00:00:26,460
We've discussed a number of different techniques to approach this,

9
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:28,995
ranging from low intervention to high intervention.

10
00:00:28,995 --> 00:00:32,300
On the low side, we can just observe our users in the wild

11
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:35,855
or we can become users ourselves and participate in the task.

12
00:00:35,855 --> 00:00:39,220
Working up, when you try to look at more closely at users areas to

13
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:43,220
find errors or hacks or perused the data that they're already generating,

14
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:45,800
we might interact with them directly through surveys,

15
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,350
interviews, or focus groups,

16
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:49,640
or we might choose to work alongside them,

17
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:51,830
not just participating in the task independently,

18
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:55,160
but learning from them and developing expertise itself.

19
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:57,410
Once you've gained the efficient understanding,

20
00:00:57,410 --> 00:01:01,210
it's time to move on to the next step, brainstorming design alternatives.
