1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,925
The relationship between HCI and user experience design is a little bit closer.

2
00:00:04,925 --> 00:00:07,620
In fact, if you ask a dozen people working in the field,

3
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:10,725
you'll likely get a dozen different answers about the difference.

4
00:00:10,725 --> 00:00:13,485
For the purposes of our conversations,

5
00:00:13,485 --> 00:00:15,645
we'll think about the difference like this.

6
00:00:15,645 --> 00:00:20,775
HCI is largely about understanding the interactions between humans and computers.

7
00:00:20,775 --> 00:00:26,265
User experience design is about dictating the interactions between users and computers.

8
00:00:26,265 --> 00:00:29,145
In order to design user experiences very well,

9
00:00:29,145 --> 00:00:30,795
you need to understand the user.

10
00:00:30,795 --> 00:00:33,495
You need to understand their interactions with interfaces.

11
00:00:33,495 --> 00:00:36,810
That's why I personally consider user experience design to be

12
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:40,125
a subfield of the broader area of HCI.

13
00:00:40,125 --> 00:00:43,340
In our conversations, we'll use the principles and methods from

14
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:46,670
HCI to inform how we design user experiences.

15
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:50,420
But it's important to note that this relationship is deeply symbiotic.

16
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:53,660
We might use that understanding to inform how we design

17
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:56,330
user experiences but then we evaluate

18
00:00:56,330 --> 00:00:59,570
those designs and based on their success or failures,

19
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:04,100
we'll use that to inform our increasing knowledge of human computer interaction itself.

20
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:06,885
If our understanding leads us to create good designs,

21
00:01:06,885 --> 00:01:09,770
that provides evidence that our understanding is correct.

22
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:14,600
If we create a design with some understanding and that design doesn't work,

23
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:17,270
then maybe our understanding was flawed, and now,

24
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:20,970
our understanding of human computer interaction as a whole will increase.

25
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:24,980
This is similar to something called design-based research which we'll talk about later.

26
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:27,560
Using the results of our designs to conduct

27
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:30,050
research and you might also notice

28
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:33,005
this is very related to our concept of feedback cycles.

29
00:01:33,005 --> 00:01:35,840
Just as a user uses an interface to participate in

30
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,320
some task and then evaluates the result of their interaction,

31
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:43,910
so also, we design interfaces and evaluate their success.

32
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:46,370
You'll find the feedback cycles are really all over

33
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:49,610
this course and all over the world in general.
