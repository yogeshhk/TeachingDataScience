1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,020
The social portion of distributed
cognition is concerned with

2
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:07,530
how social connections create systems
that can, together, accomplish tasks.

3
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:10,790
So for example, you and your friend
sitting in the passenger seat, together

4
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:15,670
form a system capable of navigating
to a new destination without a GPS.

5
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:18,650
But social cognition is not only
concerned with how social relationships

6
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:20,520
combine to accomplish tasks.

7
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:23,670
It's also concerned with the cognitive
underpinning of social interactions

8
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:24,770
themselves.

9
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:27,400
It's interested in how perception,
memory, and

10
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:30,020
learning relate to social phenomena.

11
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:33,240
As interface designers though,
why do we care?

12
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:35,865
Well, in case you haven't noticed,
one of the most common applications

13
00:00:35,865 --> 00:00:38,975
of interface design today
involves social media.

14
00:00:38,975 --> 00:00:40,835
Everything is becoming social.

15
00:00:40,835 --> 00:00:43,185
Facebook tries to tell you when
your friends are already nearby.

16
00:00:43,185 --> 00:00:45,235
Udacity tries to connect you
with other students working on

17
00:00:45,235 --> 00:00:46,870
the same material as you.

18
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:49,910
Video games are increasingly trying to
convince you to share your achievements

19
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:51,790
and highlights with your friends.

20
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:53,190
And yet, often times,

21
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:57,110
our interfaces are at odds with how we
really think about social interaction.

22
00:00:57,110 --> 00:00:58,490
Designing for this well involves

23
00:00:58,490 --> 00:01:01,980
understanding the cognitive
underpinnings of social relationships.

24
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:04,180
My Play Station, for
example, has a feature for

25
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:08,770
finding my real life friends, and then
communicating to them my gaming habits.

26
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:09,670
But really,

27
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:12,660
I probably don't want them to know
how much I might play video games.

28
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:15,890
If I come unprepared for recording
today, I certainly don't want Amanda to

29
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:19,000
know it was because I was playing
Skyrim for six hours last night.

30
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,790
So if we're going to design interfaces
that integrate with social interactions,

31
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:26,410
we have to understand how social
interactions actually work.

32
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:29,900
So an understanding of social
cognition is very important

33
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:31,170
if that's the direction
you want to take.
