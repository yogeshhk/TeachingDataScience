00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:02,680
When I was writing the script for
this exact video,

2
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:04,780
I was interrupted by a text
message from a friend of mine.

3
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:08,370
And in the reply I was writing,
I wanted to include a smiley face.

4
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:12,570
We know that using emojis and emoticons
tends to humanize textual communication.

5
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:16,190
On my phone, the interface for inserting
an emoji is to tap an icon to bring up

6
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:19,550
a list of all the emojis and
then select the one that you want.

7
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:21,310
When I'm reacting to
someone in conversation,

8
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:24,260
I'm not mentally scrolling through
a list of all my possible emotions and

9
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:26,030
then choosing the one that corresponds.

10
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:28,170
I'm just reacting naturally.

11
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:30,060
Why can't my phone capture that?

12
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:32,595
Instead of having to select
smiling from a list of emotions,

13
00:00:32,595 --> 00:00:35,795
maybe my phone could just have a button
to insert the emotion corresponding to

14
00:00:35,795 --> 00:00:37,385
my current facial expression.

15
00:00:37,385 --> 00:00:38,735
So to wink, I would just wink.

16
00:00:38,735 --> 00:00:39,825
To frown, I would just frown.

17
00:00:39,825 --> 00:00:43,295
It wouldn't be possible to capture
every possible face, but for

18
00:00:43,295 --> 00:00:45,795
some of the most commonly used ones,
it might be more efficient.
