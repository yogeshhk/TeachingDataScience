00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:02,610
A good example of the difference
between affordances and

2
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:04,900
mappings is a light switch.

3
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:07,939
A light switch very clearly affords
how you're supposed to use it.

4
00:00:07,939 --> 00:00:09,540
You're supposed to flip it.

5
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:13,990
But these switches have no mapping to
what will happen when I switch them.

6
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:16,990
I can look at it and
clearly see what I'm supposed to do.

7
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:19,570
But I can't tell what the effect
is going to be in the real world.

8
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,460
Contrast with the dials on my stove.

9
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:27,390
There are four dials and
each is augmented with this little icon

10
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:30,130
that tells you which burner
is controlled by that dial.

11
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:33,690
So there's a mapping between
the controls and the effects.

12
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:38,600
So how would you redesign these light
switches to create not only affordances

13
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,330
but also mappings.

14
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:43,020
If relevant, this one turns
on the breakfast room light,

15
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:45,910
this one turns on the counter light and
this one turns on the kitchen light.
