1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:01,750
Norman takes us a step further though,

2
00:00:01,750 --> 00:00:05,040
when he breaks down constraints
into four sub-categories.

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,730
These aren't just about
preventing wrong input.

4
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:10,340
They're also about
insuring correct input.

5
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:12,720
They're about making sure
the user knows what to do next.

6
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:17,020
Physical constraints are those that are
literally physically prevent you from

7
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:18,640
performing the wrong action.

8
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,080
A three-prong plug, for

9
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:24,690
example, can only physically be inserted
in one way, which prevents mistakes.

10
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:27,970
USB sticks can only be physically
inserted one way all the way.

11
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:30,770
But the constraint doesn't arise
until you've already tried to do it

12
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:31,840
incorrectly.

13
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,250
You can look at a wall outlet and

14
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:35,260
understand if you're trying
to put it incorrectly.

15
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:36,800
But it's harder to look at a USB and

16
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,220
know whether you're trying
to insert it the right way.

17
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:42,170
A second kind is a cultural constraint.

18
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:44,990
These are those rules that are generally
followed by different societies,

19
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:48,370
like facing forward on escalators,
or forming a line while waiting.

20
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:51,710
In designing we might rely on these, but

21
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:54,770
we should be careful of
intercultural differences.

22
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:57,530
A third kind of constraint
is a semantic constraint.

23
00:00:57,530 --> 00:01:00,290
Those are constraints that are inherent
to the meaning of a situation.

24
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:02,980
They're similar to
affordances in that regard.

25
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:07,270
For example, the purpose of a rear
view mirror is to see behind you.

26
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:11,500
So therefore, the mirror must reflect
from behind, it's inherent to the idea

27
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:14,010
of a rear view mirror,
that it should reflect in a certain way.

28
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:17,000
In the future that meaning might change,

29
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,010
autonomous vehicles might not
need mirrors for passengers, so

30
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:23,250
the semantic constraints of today,
might be gone tomorrow.

31
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:26,790
And finally the fourth kind of
constraint is a logical constraint.

32
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:30,030
Logical constraints are things that
are self-evident based on a situation,

33
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:33,070
not just based on the design of
something like a semantic constraint,

34
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:35,420
but based on the situation at hand.

35
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:37,930
For example,
imagine building some furniture.

36
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:41,610
When you reach the end, there's only
one hole left, and only one screw.

37
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:44,210
Logically, the one screw
left is constrained to go in

38
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:46,020
the one remaining hole.

39
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:47,280
That's a logical constraint.
