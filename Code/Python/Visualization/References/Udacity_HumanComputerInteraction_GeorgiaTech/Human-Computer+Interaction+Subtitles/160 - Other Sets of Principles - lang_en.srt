1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,050
So, I've attempted to distill the 29 combined principles from Norman,

2
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:09,570
Nielsen, Constantine, Lockwood, and the Center for Universal Design into just these 15.

3
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:12,870
Here you can see where each of these principles comes from.

4
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:15,960
I do recommend reading the original four lists to pick up on some

5
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:19,220
of the more subtle differences between these principles that I've grouped together,

6
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:22,755
especially perceptibility, tolerance, and feedback.

7
00:00:22,755 --> 00:00:25,290
Note also that in more recent editions,

8
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:28,325
Norman has one more principle: conceptual models.

9
00:00:28,325 --> 00:00:31,850
That's actually the subject of an entire lesson in this course.

10
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:34,280
These also certainly aren't the only four sets of

11
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:36,745
design principles. There are several more.

12
00:00:36,745 --> 00:00:38,760
For example, Dix, Finlay, Abowd,

13
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:41,690
and Beale proposed three categories of principles:

14
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:44,945
learnability for how easily a new user can grasp an interface,

15
00:00:44,945 --> 00:00:48,185
flexibility for how many ways an interface can be used,

16
00:00:48,185 --> 00:00:52,715
and robustness for how well an interface gives feedback and recovers from errors.

17
00:00:52,715 --> 00:00:56,425
We talk about their learnability principles when we discussed mental models.

18
00:00:56,425 --> 00:01:00,470
Jill Gerhardt-Powals has a list of principles for cognitive engineering,

19
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:02,855
aimed especially at reducing cognitive load.

20
00:01:02,855 --> 00:01:07,040
Her list is in particularly useful applications for data processing and visualization.

21
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,580
In "The Human Interface",

22
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:12,410
Jef Raskin outline some additional revolutionary design rules.

23
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:15,019
I wouldn't necessarily advocate following them,

24
00:01:15,019 --> 00:01:18,305
but they're interesting to see a very different approach to things.

25
00:01:18,305 --> 00:01:20,855
In "Computer Graphics Principles and Practice",

26
00:01:20,855 --> 00:01:23,180
Jim Foley and others give some principles that apply

27
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:26,425
specifically to 2D and 3D computer graphics.

28
00:01:26,425 --> 00:01:29,750
Finally, Susan Weinschenk and Dean Barker have a set of guidelines that

29
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:32,930
provide an even more holistic view of interface design,

30
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:35,405
including things like linguistic and cultural sensitivity,

31
00:01:35,405 --> 00:01:38,230
tempo and pace, and domain clarity.

32
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:40,610
Even these are only some of the additional lists.

33
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:43,040
There are many more that I encourage you to look into.

34
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,940
We'll provide some on the notes.
