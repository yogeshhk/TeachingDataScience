00:00:00,445 --> 00:00:02,638
Let's go back to our original
design challenge for

2
00:00:02,638 --> 00:00:04,578
Morgan from the very
beginning of this unit.

3
00:00:04,578 --> 00:00:07,501
We talked about how Morgan wants to
be able to listen to audio books on

4
00:00:07,501 --> 00:00:11,420
the go which includes things like
leaving bookmarks and taking notes.

5
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:15,080
Using everything we've talked about so
far, revisit this problem.

6
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:18,230
Start by thinking narrowly about the
physical interactions between Morgan and

7
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:22,220
the interface and then zoom out to her
interactions with the task as a whole,

8
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:25,450
then zoom out even further to how
the interaction between Morgan and

9
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:29,375
the interface or relates to other things
going on in the world around here.

10
00:00:29,375 --> 00:00:32,110
And last,
think about how interfaces like this

11
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:34,430
have the potential to
effect society itself.
