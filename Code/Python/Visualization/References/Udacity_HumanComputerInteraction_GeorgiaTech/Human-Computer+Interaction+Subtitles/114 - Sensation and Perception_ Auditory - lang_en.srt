1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:02,710
Morgan also has ears.

2
00:00:02,710 --> 00:00:06,620
Morgan can discern noises based on
both their pitch and their loudness.

3
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:10,210
Her ears are remarkably good
at localizing sound as well.

4
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:13,550
In fact, she can tell the difference
between a nearby quiet sound and

5
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:15,260
a far away loud sound.

6
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:16,640
Even if their relative pitches and

7
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,290
loudnesses are the same
when they reach her ear.

8
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:22,020
Unlike vision,
hearing isn't directional.

9
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:25,250
Morgan can't close her ears or
point her ears the wrong direction so

10
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:28,330
she can't as easily filter
out auditory information.

11
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:31,300
That might be useful for designing
alerts, but it's problematic for

12
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:34,190
overwhelming her or sharing too much
information with the people around her.
