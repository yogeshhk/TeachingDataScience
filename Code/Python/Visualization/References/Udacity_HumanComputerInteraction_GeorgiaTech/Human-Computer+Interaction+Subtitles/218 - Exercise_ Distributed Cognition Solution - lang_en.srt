1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,340
We're interested in any part of
the system that performs some of

2
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:05,440
the cognition for Morgan.

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:06,670
While the chair, table, and

4
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:11,130
light over head make this possible,
they aren't serving any cognitive roles.

5
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:15,320
Morgan herself, of course, is,
and two piles of bills are too.

6
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:18,610
They are an external memory of what
bills Morgan has already paid, and

7
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:20,320
what she still needs to pay.

8
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,050
This way she doesn't have to mentally
keep track of what bills she has

9
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:24,320
left to do.

10
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,410
The bills themselves remember
a lot of the information for

11
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:30,330
her as well like the amounts and the
destinations they need to be sent to.

12
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:32,040
What about the pen and checkbook?

13
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,590
That's when things start to
get a little bit more tricky.

14
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:37,170
The checkbook itself is part of
the system because it takes care of

15
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:39,390
the record keeping task for Morgan.

16
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:40,820
Checkbooks create carbon copies,

17
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:44,450
which means Morgan doesn't have to think
about tracking the checks manually.

18
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:47,320
The pen is a means of communicating
between these systems,

19
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,740
which means it's part of our
distributed cognition system as well.
