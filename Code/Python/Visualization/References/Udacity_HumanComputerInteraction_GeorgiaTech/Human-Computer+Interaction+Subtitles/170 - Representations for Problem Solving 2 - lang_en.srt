00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:04,280
For simple problems, identifying
a good representation can be easy.

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:06,810
But what about for
more complex problems?

3
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:07,590
For those problems,

4
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:10,600
we might need some examples of
what makes a good representation.

5
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:12,710
So let's try a complex example.

6
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:15,629
We'll use a problem with
which you might be familiar.

7
00:00:15,629 --> 00:00:18,600
For now, I'll call it the circles and
squares problem.

8
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,922
On one side of a table,
I have three circles and three squares.

9
00:00:21,922 --> 00:00:23,946
My goal is to move the three circles and

10
00:00:23,946 --> 00:00:26,360
three squares to the other
side of the table.

11
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:29,463
I can only move two shapes at at time,
and the direction of the moves must

12
00:00:29,463 --> 00:00:31,550
alternate, starting with
a move to the right.

13
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:36,940
The number of squares on either side can
never outnumber the number of circles

14
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:40,330
unless there are no circles
at all on that side.

15
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:42,710
How many moves does it
take to accomplish this?

16
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:45,820
Try it out and enter the number
of moves it takes in the box.

17
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:47,240
Or just skip if you give up.
