00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,210
A lot of current efforts in healthcare
are about processing the massive

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:05,850
quantities of data that
are recorded everyday.

3
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:07,230
But in order to make that data useful,

4
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:09,680
it has to connect to real
people at some point.

5
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:13,370
Maybe it's equipping doctors with tools
to more easily visually evaluate and

6
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:15,400
compare different diagnoses.

7
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:18,220
Maybe it's giving patients the tools
necessary to monitor their own health

8
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:19,780
and treatment options.

9
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:21,550
Maybe that's information
visualization so

10
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:24,850
patients can understand how certain
decisions affect their well-being.

11
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:27,720
Maybe it's context aware computing that
can detect when patients are about to do

12
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:29,000
something they probably shouldn't do.

13
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,550
There are also numerous applications of
HCI to personal health like Fitbit for

14
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:36,830
exercise monitoring or
MyFitnessPal for tracking your diet.

15
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:40,110
Those interfaces succeed if
they're easily usable for users.

16
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:42,220
Ideally, they'd be almost invisible.

17
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:44,850
But perhaps the most fascinating
upcoming intersection of HCI and

18
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:47,240
health care is in virtual reality.

19
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:50,080
Virtual reality exercise programs
are already pretty common to make living

20
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:53,960
an active lifestyle more fun, but
what about virtual reality for therapy?

21
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,730
That's actually already happening.

22
00:00:55,730 --> 00:00:58,130
We can use virtual reality to
help people confront fears and

23
00:00:58,130 --> 00:01:01,470
anxieties in a safe, but
highly authentic place.

24
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:04,450
Healthcare in general is concerned
with the health of humans.

25
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:07,110
And computers are pretty commonly
used in modern healthcare.

26
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:09,660
So the applications of human
computer interaction to healthcare

27
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:10,500
are really huge.
