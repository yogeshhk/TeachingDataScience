00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:07,560
In this lesson, we introduced the concept of the Design Life Cycle.

2
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:10,050
There are lots of versions of the Design Life Cycle out there,

3
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:13,005
but we're going to focus on the most general four-step cycle.

4
00:00:13,005 --> 00:00:14,835
The cycle starts with need-finding,

5
00:00:14,835 --> 00:00:17,100
then goes to constructing design alternatives,

6
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,755
and to prototyping, and then the user evaluation,

7
00:00:19,755 --> 00:00:21,495
and then the cycle repeats.

8
00:00:21,495 --> 00:00:25,005
The goal of this cycle is to realize user-centered design.

9
00:00:25,005 --> 00:00:28,530
Design that takes into consideration the user's needs at every step.

10
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:30,090
In the rest of this unit,

11
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:33,570
we're going to focus on filling up your Design Life Cycle toolbox with

12
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:35,190
tools for gathering the right kind of data at

13
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:37,740
the right time and using it in the right way.
