00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,710
First, let's start by comparing HCI to the broader field of human factors.

2
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:07,140
Human factors is interested in designing interactions

3
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:10,020
between people and products, systems or devices.

4
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:12,270
That should sound familiar. We're interested in

5
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:14,820
designing the interactions between people and computers,

6
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:17,730
but computers are themselves products or systems.

7
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:21,255
But human factors is interested in non-computing parts of this as well.

8
00:00:21,255 --> 00:00:23,775
Let's take an example. I have

9
00:00:23,775 --> 00:00:27,855
a pretty new electric car which means there are tons of computers all over it.

10
00:00:27,855 --> 00:00:29,280
From an HCI perspective,

11
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:31,320
I might be interested in visualizing the data on

12
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:33,795
the dashboard or helping the driver control the radio.

13
00:00:33,795 --> 00:00:36,060
Human factors is interested not only in how I

14
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:38,460
interact with the computerized parts of the car,

15
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:40,730
but the non computerized parts as well.

16
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:43,250
It's interested in things like the height of the steering wheel,

17
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:45,770
the size of the mirrors, or the position of the chair.

18
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:48,819
It's interested in designing the entire environment,

19
00:00:48,819 --> 00:00:50,940
not just the electronic elements.

20
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:52,760
But that means it's interested in a lot of

21
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:55,130
the same human characteristics that we care about,

22
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:59,000
like how people perceive the world and their own expectations about it.

23
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,130
So, many of the principles we'll discuss in

24
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:03,895
this class come from human factors engineering,

25
00:01:03,895 --> 00:01:06,890
applied more narrowly to computerized systems.

26
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:10,759
But the exciting thing is that as computers become more and more ubiquitous,

27
00:01:10,759 --> 00:01:14,080
the number of application areas for HCI is growing.

28
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,780
Twenty years ago, a car might not have been an application of HCI.

29
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:22,640
Ten years ago, a wristwatch would have been more about industrial design than HCI.

30
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,680
Within only the past couple years,

31
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,885
things like shower heads and refrigerators

32
00:01:26,885 --> 00:01:29,855
has started to become truly computerized devices.

33
00:01:29,855 --> 00:01:33,620
As computers integrate themselves into more and more of our devices,

34
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:38,395
the gap between human-computer interaction and human factors engineering is shrinking.

35
00:01:38,395 --> 00:01:41,135
As computers become more and more ubiquitous,

36
00:01:41,135 --> 00:01:43,910
there's coming a time when pretty much every single thing on

37
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:47,840
your car will actually be run through a computer. Don't believe me?

38
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:53,150
Check out the inside of Tesla's Model S. When you look at the console of a Tesla,

39
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:55,660
almost everything you see is a giant computer.

40
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:57,799
Cars have become computers on wheels,

41
00:01:57,799 --> 00:01:59,765
watches have become computers on wristbands,

42
00:01:59,765 --> 00:02:02,150
car keys have become computers on key chains.

43
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:06,570
Computers are everywhere, and so HCI is everywhere.
