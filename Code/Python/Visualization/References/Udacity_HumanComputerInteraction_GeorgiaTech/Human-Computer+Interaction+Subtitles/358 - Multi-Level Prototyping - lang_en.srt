00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:02,850
There's one other misconception
that I've seen in some designers

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:06,560
I've worked with that I feel is also
worth explicitly acknowledging.

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:10,620
All your prototypes don't have to be
at the same level, at the same time.

4
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:12,420
Take Facebook for example.

5
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:15,480
Facebook is a complete
app already implemented.

6
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:18,880
Imagine that Facebook wanted to
redesign their status update box, which

7
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,790
they've done pretty recently and have
probably done since I recorded this.

8
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:26,400
Just because the interface is complete
in other ways doesn't mean that

9
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,310
all future prototyping efforts need
to be similarly high fidelity.

10
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:33,910
They don't need to implement an entire
new status composition screen

11
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:35,350
just to prototype it.

12
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:39,230
They can prototype it in lower fidelity
with sketches, or wire frames, put that

13
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:42,500
in front of users, get their feedback,
before ever actually implementing it

14
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:45,820
into a functional prototype or
a working part of the website.

15
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:48,360
This applies particularly
strongly to the design of apps or

16
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,420
programs with multiple functions.

17
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:52,328
So take something like the LinkedIn app.

18
00:00:52,328 --> 00:00:55,484
It has a number of different functions
like editing your own profile, or

19
00:00:55,484 --> 00:00:58,170
connecting with others, or
browsing your news feed.

20
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:01,920
Each of these individual screens
has its own tasks and interactions.

21
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,930
And moving amongst them, is itself
a task or a type of interaction.

22
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:07,920
Trying to design all the screens and

23
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,100
the transitions among them all at
the same time is likely far too much.

24
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:14,960
So we could take the bottom-up approach,
where we would design the individual

25
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:19,210
screens first, and then design
the app experience as a whole.

26
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:20,580
Or we might take
the top-down approach and

27
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:24,300
design the overall experience of moving
between these different screens, and

28
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:27,690
then design the contents
of the individual screens.

29
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:30,890
The point of this is that at any time,
protoyping can and

30
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:33,400
should exist at multiple
levels of fidelity.
