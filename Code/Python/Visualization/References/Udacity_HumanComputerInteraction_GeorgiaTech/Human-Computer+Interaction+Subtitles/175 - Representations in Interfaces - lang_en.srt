00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:03,180
Representations are all around
us in the real world, but

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:05,790
they play a huge role in interfaces.

3
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:09,360
Designing representations of the current
state of a system is actually one of

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,500
the most common tasks you might
perform as an interface designer.

5
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:15,160
So let's take a look at a few,

6
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:18,250
here's Google Calendar which is
a representation of my week.

7
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:21,400
Notice how it actually uses space
to represent blocks of time.

8
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:24,670
It allows me to quickly feel how long
different things are going to take.

9
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:28,240
An alternate visualization might show
an entire month instead of a week, but

10
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,756
it would lose those indicators that
linked the individual appointments.

11
00:00:31,756 --> 00:00:33,420
So it doesn't really
represent the structure and

12
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:36,580
pace of my day,
the way the weekly calendar does.

13
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:39,690
This representation also allows me
to very easily find conflicts in my

14
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:40,530
schedule.

15
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:43,340
So I know when I might need
to reschedule something.

16
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:45,900
On Friday I can see that I have
a conflict for one of my meetings.

17
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:48,670
And this interface also
makes it easy to reschedule.

18
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:51,170
I can pull up the calendar for
the other person I'm meeting with and

19
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:54,040
identify places where we both
have free in our schedule.

20
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:56,904
Another example of this is
the PowerPoint animation pang.

21
00:00:56,904 --> 00:00:59,608
The numbers here represent
when different animations

22
00:00:59,608 --> 00:01:01,210
happen concurrently.

23
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:04,099
The middle icon represents what
triggers the animation, and

24
00:01:04,099 --> 00:01:07,130
the right icon indicates the general
nature of the animation.

25
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:10,450
Whether it's a movement,
a highlight or an appearance.

26
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:13,430
The PC version of PowerPoint makes this
even better by actually showing you

27
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:16,030
a timeline of the different
animations to the right.

28
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:19,060
That lets you very easily visualize when
two different things are going to happen

29
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:20,150
at the same time.

30
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:22,670
Or when something waits for
something else to happen.

31
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:26,030
These are just two of the many many
representations you use whenever you

32
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:27,290
use a computer.

33
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:28,120
Scroll bars for

34
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:32,280
example, are representations of your
relative position in a document.

35
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:35,520
Highlighting markers like that rectangle
are representations of what you

36
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,970
currently have selected.

37
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:40,490
All these representations work together
to help your mental model match

38
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:42,380
the real state of the system.

39
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:46,243
Representations when used correctly
can make many tasks trivial, or

40
00:01:46,243 --> 00:01:47,700
even invisible.

41
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:50,340
And we as interface designers
have a lot of control

42
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:52,360
over representations in our designs.
