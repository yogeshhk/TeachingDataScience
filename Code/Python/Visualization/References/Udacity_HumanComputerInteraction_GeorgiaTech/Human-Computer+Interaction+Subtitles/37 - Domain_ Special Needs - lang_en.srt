1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,910
One of the most exciting application areas for

2
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:05,700
HCI is in helping people with special needs.

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:09,930
Computing can help us compensate for disability, injuries, aging.

4
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:12,360
Think of a robotic prosthetic for example.

5
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:14,369
Of course, part of that is engineering,

6
00:00:14,369 --> 00:00:15,900
part of it is neuroscience.

7
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:18,510
But it's also important to understand how the person intends to

8
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:21,195
use such a limb and the tasks they need to perform.

9
00:00:21,195 --> 00:00:24,225
That's HCI intersecting with robotics.

10
00:00:24,225 --> 00:00:27,915
Or take another example from some work done here at Georgia Tech by Bruce Walker.

11
00:00:27,915 --> 00:00:30,690
How do you communicate data to a blind person?

12
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:32,805
We've talked about information visualization,

13
00:00:32,805 --> 00:00:35,055
but if it's a visualization,

14
00:00:35,055 --> 00:00:37,650
it's leaving out a significant portion of the population.

15
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:41,800
So, Dr. Walker Sonification Lab works in communicating data using sound.

16
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:44,390
A lot of the emerging areas of HCI technology could have

17
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:46,790
extraordinary significance to people with special needs.

18
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:50,660
Imagine virtual reality for people suffering from some form of paralysis,

19
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:52,910
or imagine using artificial intelligence with

20
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:55,760
context-aware computing to create an autonomous wheelchair.

21
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,285
These are projects would only target a small portion of the population.

22
00:00:59,285 --> 00:01:03,680
But the impact of that portion would be absolutely indescribable.
