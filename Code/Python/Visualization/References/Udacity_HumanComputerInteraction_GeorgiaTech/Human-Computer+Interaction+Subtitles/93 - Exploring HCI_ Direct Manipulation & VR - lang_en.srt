00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,775
Virtual reality right now is making some incredible strides in facilitating

2
00:00:03,775 --> 00:00:07,485
direct manipulation in places where it just hasn't been possible before.

3
00:00:07,485 --> 00:00:10,050
Traditionally, when designers are designing stuff in 3D,

4
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:12,150
they are forced to use a 2D interface,

5
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:14,400
that translation from 2D to 3D really gets in

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,145
the way of directly manipulating whatever is being designed.

7
00:00:17,145 --> 00:00:18,570
Through virtual reality though,

8
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:20,310
designers are able to view what they're designing in

9
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:22,845
3D as if it's in the room there with them.

10
00:00:22,845 --> 00:00:23,910
They can rotate it around with

11
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:26,520
the same hand motions you'd use to rotate a physical object.

12
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:29,630
They can physically move around the object to get different angles on it.

13
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:32,270
So, virtual reality is allowing us to bring the principle of

14
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:35,675
direct manipulation to tasks it hasn't been able to touch before,

15
00:00:35,675 --> 00:00:37,610
but there's still a lot of work to do.

16
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:41,750
Gesture interfaces like those used in virtual reality struggle with some feedback issues.

17
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:44,975
We aimed to make the user feel like they're physically manipulating the artifact.

18
00:00:44,975 --> 00:00:46,580
When you're working with something with your hands,

19
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:48,145
it pushes back against you.

20
00:00:48,145 --> 00:00:51,090
How do we recreate that in virtual reality?
