00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:09,234
For this portion of our conversation
about human computer interaction,

3
00:00:09,234 --> 00:00:11,992
we're going to talk about some
established principals that we'd

4
00:00:11,992 --> 00:00:14,880
uncovered after decades of
designing user interfaces.

5
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,660
We want to understand the fundamental
building blocks of HCI, and

6
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:21,210
separately we'll talk about how
to build on those foundations to

7
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:23,720
do new research and new development.

8
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:24,410
To get started, though,

9
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:28,450
let's first define some of the
overarching ideas of design principles.

10
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:32,061
In this lesson, we're going to talk
about the way we focus on users and

11
00:00:32,061 --> 00:00:34,953
tasks in HCI, not on tools and
interfaces on their own.

12
00:00:34,953 --> 00:00:37,637
We're going to talk about
the role of the interface and

13
00:00:37,637 --> 00:00:39,836
how it mediates between user and
the task.

14
00:00:39,836 --> 00:00:43,462
We're going to discuss different views
on the user's role in the system.

15
00:00:43,462 --> 00:00:45,962
And we're going to talk about user
experience more generally and

16
00:00:45,962 --> 00:00:48,280
how it exists at several
different levels.

17
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:51,360
Along the way, we'll tackle some
design challenges, reflect on our own

18
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:55,080
experiences, and try to apply what we
learn to the broader field of HCI.
