1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,675
Prototyping is largely about the trade-offs we have to make.

2
00:00:03,675 --> 00:00:07,680
Low-fidelity prototypes like drawings are easy to create and modify,

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,625
but they aren't as effective for detailed comprehensive evaluations.

4
00:00:11,625 --> 00:00:14,625
High-fidelity prototypes like actual working interfaces

5
00:00:14,625 --> 00:00:17,340
can be used for detailed feedback and evaluation,

6
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:18,990
but they're difficult to actually put together.

7
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:22,500
So, our goal is to maximize these trade-offs.

8
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,530
We want to start with the easier low-fidelity prototypes to get

9
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:27,900
initial ideas to evaluate big designs

10
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:30,615
and big plans and to make sure we're on the right track.

11
00:00:30,615 --> 00:00:32,055
Then as we go along,

12
00:00:32,055 --> 00:00:35,270
we can move towards the higher-fidelity prototypes to take more time to

13
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:39,185
assemble because we have initial evidence that our designs are actually sound.

14
00:00:39,185 --> 00:00:43,475
It's really important here also to note that our prototypes are prototypes.

15
00:00:43,475 --> 00:00:45,410
They aren't complete interfaces.

16
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:48,140
We've discussed in the past that designers often have a tendency

17
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:51,560
to jump straight to designing rather than getting to know their users.

18
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:54,560
That's a big risk here as well because we're designing,

19
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:57,050
but we're designing specifically to get more feedback.

20
00:00:57,050 --> 00:00:59,635
So, don't become a runaway train of designing.

21
00:00:59,635 --> 00:01:02,810
Designed deliberately and get feedback often.
