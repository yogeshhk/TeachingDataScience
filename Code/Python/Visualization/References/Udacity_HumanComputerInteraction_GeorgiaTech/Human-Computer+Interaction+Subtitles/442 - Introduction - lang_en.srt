00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:07,620
At the beginning of our conversations,

2
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:12,345
we talked about how HCI is part of a broader hierarchy of fields.

3
00:00:12,345 --> 00:00:15,120
It draws a lot from human factors engineering, and in fact,

4
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:19,785
in many ways, it's human factors engineering applied specifically to software.

5
00:00:19,785 --> 00:00:21,720
It also has numerous subfields,

6
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,325
like user interface design,

7
00:00:23,325 --> 00:00:27,300
user experience design, computer-supported cooperative work, and more.

8
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:29,820
In this lesson, we want to let you know where

9
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:32,430
you might want to go next in your exploration of HCI,

10
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:34,125
in terms of subject matter.

11
00:00:34,125 --> 00:00:37,785
Note that these are different from the areas of application of HCI.

12
00:00:37,785 --> 00:00:41,250
When we talk about things like virtual reality or educational technology,

13
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:44,445
we're describing fields to which HCI applies.

14
00:00:44,445 --> 00:00:48,460
Here, we're talking about HCI subfields themselves.
