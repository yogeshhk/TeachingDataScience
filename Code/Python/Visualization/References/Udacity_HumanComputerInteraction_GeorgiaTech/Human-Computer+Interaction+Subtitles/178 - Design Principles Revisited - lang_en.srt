00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,640
In our lesson on design principles,
we touch on a number of principles that

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:07,920
are relevant to these ideas of mental
models, representations, and metaphors.

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:11,120
First, the idea that people reason
by analogy to pass interfaces,

4
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:12,910
or by metaphors to the real world,

5
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:16,682
is one of the reasons that the principle
of consistency is so important.

6
00:00:16,682 --> 00:00:18,370
We want to be consistent
with the analogies and

7
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:21,980
metaphors that people use to
make sense of our interfaces.

8
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:25,370
Second, when we say that an interface
should teach the user how the system

9
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:28,590
works, we're echoing
the idea of affordances.

10
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:32,280
The way the system looks,
should tell the user how it's used.

11
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:33,799
Just by observing the system the,

12
00:00:33,799 --> 00:00:36,235
user should be learning
how to interact with it.

13
00:00:37,235 --> 00:00:40,615
Third, representations are important
because they map the interphase,

14
00:00:40,615 --> 00:00:42,445
to the task at hand.

15
00:00:42,445 --> 00:00:45,535
A good representation is one that
users can use predict the outcomes

16
00:00:45,535 --> 00:00:46,815
of certain actions.

17
00:00:46,815 --> 00:00:50,505
In other words, a good representation
let's users predict the mapping

18
00:00:50,505 --> 00:00:53,795
between their actions in the interphase,
and the outcomes out in the world.
