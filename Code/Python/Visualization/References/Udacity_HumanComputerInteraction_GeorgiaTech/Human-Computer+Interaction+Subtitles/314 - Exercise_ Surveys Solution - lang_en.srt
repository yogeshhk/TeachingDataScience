00:00:00,047 --> 00:00:03,480
Here are a few of the problems that
I intentionally put into this survey.

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:06,174
Some of them are kind of obvious, but
hopefully a couple others were a little

3
00:00:06,174 --> 00:00:08,510
bit more subtle and
a little bit more interesting.

4
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:11,490
First when I say on a scale of one
to four with one meaning a lot and

5
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:14,920
four meaning not at all,
what do two and three mean exactly?

6
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:18,280
It's not a very clear scale
to just say the endpoint.

7
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:21,180
Just giving the endpoints
doesn't give a very clear scale.

8
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:24,190
We usually also want to provide
an odd number of options, so

9
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:26,740
that users have kind of
a neutral central option.

10
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:29,000
Sometimes we'll want to force our
participants to take one side or

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,810
the other, but generally we want to
give them that middle neutral option.

12
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:35,820
Either way though, we definitely don't
want to change the number of options

13
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:37,520
between those two questions.

14
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:42,300
Having one be 1 to 4 and
the other be 1 to 6 is just confusing.

15
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:46,080
And even worse, notice that we're
reversing the scale between these two.

16
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,399
In the first question,
the low number means a lot.

17
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:51,180
In the second question,
the high number means a lot.

18
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:52,930
That's just terrible design.

19
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:55,560
We want to be consistent
across our entire survey,

20
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,490
both with the direction of our scale and

21
00:00:57,490 --> 00:01:01,410
the number of options unless
there's a compelling reason not to.

22
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:05,220
The second question is also guilty
of being quite a leading question.

23
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:08,695
Why do you like to exercise assumes
the participant likes to exercise.

24
00:01:08,695 --> 00:01:10,980
What are they supposed
to say if they don't?

25
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:13,700
And finally, the last question
is a yes or no question.

26
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:15,730
Have you listened to
an audiobook this year?

27
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:16,860
Yes or no.

28
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:19,770
No is kind of an interesting answer,
but yes, I don't know if you

29
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:22,940
listened to one audiobook this year or
a 100 audiobooks this year.

30
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:25,020
I don't know if you listened
every single day or

31
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:28,230
if you just listened once because
you had a gift certificate.

32
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:31,760
So we want to reword this question
to be a little more open-ended and

33
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:34,090
support a wider range
of participant answers.
