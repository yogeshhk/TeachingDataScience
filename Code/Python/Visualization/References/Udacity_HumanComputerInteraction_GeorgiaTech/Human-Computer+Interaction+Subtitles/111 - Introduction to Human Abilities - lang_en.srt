2
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:09,150
Human computer interaction
starts with human.

3
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:11,590
So it's important that we
understand who the human is, and

4
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:13,460
what they're capable of doing.

5
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:16,329
In this lesson, we're going to bring up
some psychology of what humans can do.

6
00:00:16,329 --> 00:00:18,620
We'll look at three systems.

7
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:21,750
Input, processing, and output.

8
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:25,800
Input is how stimuli are sent from the
world, and perceived inside the mind.

9
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,140
Processing is cognition,
how the brain stores, and

10
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:30,520
reasons over the input it's received.

11
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:33,470
Output is how the brain then
controls the individual's actions

12
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:34,920
out in the world.

13
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:37,170
Now, we're going to cover a lot
of material at a very high level.

14
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:40,500
If you're interested in hearing more,
I recommend taking a psychology class,

15
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:43,210
especially one focusing on sensation and
perception.

16
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:45,120
We'll put some recommended
courses in the notes.
