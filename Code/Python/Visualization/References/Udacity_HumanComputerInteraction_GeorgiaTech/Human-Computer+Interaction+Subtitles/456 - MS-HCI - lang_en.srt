1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
If you already have a strong background in CS,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,810
you might want to go all the way to getting a master's specifically in HCI.

3
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:10,800
These programs aren't as common as MSCS Programs with HCI specializations,

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:15,270
but many universities do have them including Georgia Tech, Carnegie Mellon,

5
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:17,700
University of Washington, the University of Maryland,

6
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:21,330
Iowa State University, and the Rochester Institute of Technology.

7
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:24,765
I myself completed the MS-HCI program here at Georgia Tech,

8
00:00:24,765 --> 00:00:26,820
before starting my PhD.

9
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:29,895
In focusing an entire master's degree in HCI,

10
00:00:29,895 --> 00:00:31,920
you'll find you have even more time to spend getting into

11
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,560
the relationship between HCI and some other fields.

12
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,000
At Georgia Tech for example,

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,020
the MS-HCI program has specializations in interactive computing,

14
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:43,605
psychology, industrial design and digital media.

15
00:00:43,605 --> 00:00:47,540
That allows the flexibility to focus on different areas of HCI like,

16
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:50,450
how to integrate with physical devices in industrial design,

17
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:53,869
and how it helps us understand human cognition in psychology.

18
00:00:53,869 --> 00:00:58,455
Most masters programs in HCI that I've seen are also heavily project focused,

19
00:00:58,455 --> 00:00:59,540
Carnegie Mellon for example,

20
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:02,630
provides sponsored capstone projects from industry,

21
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:03,650
and every student in

22
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:08,245
Georgia Tech's MS-HCI program completes a six credit hour independent project.

23
00:01:08,245 --> 00:01:11,735
So, if you're really set on moving forward with a career in HCI,

24
00:01:11,735 --> 00:01:15,330
a dedicated masters in the field is a great way to move forward.
