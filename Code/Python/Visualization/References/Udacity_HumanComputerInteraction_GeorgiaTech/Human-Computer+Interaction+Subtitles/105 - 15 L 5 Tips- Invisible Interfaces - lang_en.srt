00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:06,435
Here are five tips for designing invisible interfaces.

2
00:00:06,435 --> 00:00:08,745
Number one, use affordances.

3
00:00:08,745 --> 00:00:12,000
We talked more about affordances when we discuss design principles in heuristics,

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,290
but affordances are places where

5
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:17,070
the visual design of the interface is just how it's supposed to be used.

6
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:18,465
Buttons are for pressing,

7
00:00:18,465 --> 00:00:19,560
dials are for turning,

8
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:20,925
switches are for flicking.

9
00:00:20,925 --> 00:00:24,195
Use these expectations to make your interface more useable.

10
00:00:24,195 --> 00:00:26,700
Number two, know your user.

11
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:29,640
In visibility means different things to different people.

12
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:32,820
Invisibility to a novice means the interactions are all natural,

13
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:36,105
but invisibility to an expert means maximizing efficiency.

14
00:00:36,105 --> 00:00:38,520
Know for whom you're trying to design.

15
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:41,555
Number three, differentiate your user.

16
00:00:41,555 --> 00:00:44,644
Maybe you're designing something for both novices and experts.

17
00:00:44,644 --> 00:00:45,800
If that's the case,

18
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:48,250
provide multiple ways of accomplishing tasks.

19
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:50,985
For example, having Copy and Paste under the Edit menu,

20
00:00:50,985 --> 00:00:52,640
keeps those options discoverable.

21
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:57,335
But providing control c and control v as shortcuts keep those actions efficient.

22
00:00:57,335 --> 00:01:00,590
Number four, let your interface teach.

23
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:02,960
When we think of teaching users how to use our software,

24
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,225
we usually think of tutorials or manuals.

25
00:01:05,225 --> 00:01:07,970
But ideally the interface itself will do the teaching.

26
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:10,900
For example, when users select Copy and Paste from the Edit menu,

27
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:13,535
they see the hotkey that corresponds to that function.

28
00:01:13,535 --> 00:01:16,730
The goal is to teach them more efficient way of performing the actions

29
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:20,200
without requiring them to already know that in order to do their work.

30
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,980
Number five, talk to your user.

31
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:24,500
We'll say this over and over again,

32
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,930
but the best thing you can do is talk to the user.

33
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:29,345
Ask them what they're thinking while you use an interface.

34
00:01:29,345 --> 00:01:32,470
Note especially whether they're talking about the task or the interface.

35
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:34,245
If they're talking about the interface,

36
00:01:34,245 --> 00:01:35,940
then it's pretty visible.
