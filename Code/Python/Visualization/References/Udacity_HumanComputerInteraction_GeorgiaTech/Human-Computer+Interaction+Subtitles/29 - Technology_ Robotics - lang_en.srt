1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,960
A lot of the current focus on robotics is on their physical construction and

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:08,370
abilities or on the artificial intelligence that underlies their physical forms.

3
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:10,770
But as a robotics becomes more and more mainstream,

4
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:12,990
we're going to see the emergence of a new sub-field of

5
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:16,305
human-computer interaction, human-robot interaction.

6
00:00:16,305 --> 00:00:18,165
The field actually already exists.

7
00:00:18,165 --> 00:00:22,470
The first conference on human-robot interaction took place in 2006 in Salt Lake City,

8
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:25,290
and several similar conferences have been created since then.

9
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:27,030
As robots into the mainstream,

10
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:30,495
we're going to have to answer some interesting questions about how we interact with them.

11
00:00:30,495 --> 00:00:34,890
For example, how do we ensure that robots don't harm humans through faulty reasoning?

12
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:38,400
How do we integrate robots into our social lives or do we even need to?

13
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,370
As robots are capable of more and more,

14
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:43,105
how do we deal with the loss of demand for human work?

15
00:00:43,105 --> 00:00:45,260
Now, these questions all lie at the intersection of

16
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:47,570
HCI artificial intelligence and philosophy,

17
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:50,830
in general, but there's some more concrete questions we can answer as well.

18
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:53,630
How do we pragmatically equip robots with the ability to

19
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:57,230
naturally interact with humans based on things like voice and touch?

20
00:00:57,230 --> 00:01:00,500
How do we provide tacit subtle feedback to humans interacting with robots to

21
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:04,255
confirm their input is being received and properly understood?

22
00:01:04,255 --> 00:01:08,210
How do we support humans in teaching things to robots instead of just programming

23
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:12,895
them or alternatively can we create robots that can teach things to humans?

24
00:01:12,895 --> 00:01:15,110
We already see robotics advances applied to things

25
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:17,240
like health care and disability services,

26
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:19,910
and I'm really excited to see where you take it next.
