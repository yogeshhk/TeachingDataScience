00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:02,460
Let's design something for
Morgan real quick.

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:05,080
Let's tackle the common problem of
being alerted when you've received

3
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:06,530
a text message.

4
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:08,990
Here are the constraints
on our design for Morgan.

5
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:12,350
It must alert her whether the phone
is in her pocket or on the table.

6
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:13,845
It cannot disturb the people around her.

7
00:00:13,845 --> 00:00:17,893
[SOUND] And yes, vibrating loudly
against the table counts as disturbing

8
00:00:17,893 --> 00:00:19,231
the people around her.

9
00:00:19,231 --> 00:00:21,738
You're not restricted to just
one modality, though, but

10
00:00:21,738 --> 00:00:24,458
you are restricted to the sensors
that the phone has available.
