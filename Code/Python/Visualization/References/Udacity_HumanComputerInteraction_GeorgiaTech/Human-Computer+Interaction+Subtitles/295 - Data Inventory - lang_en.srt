1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,360
Before we start our need-finding
exercises, we also want to enter with

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:06,060
some understanding of
the data we want to gather.

3
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:09,020
These are the questions we
ultimately want to answer.

4
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:12,160
That's not to say we should be answering
them every step of the way, but rather,

5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,290
we want to gather the data necessary
to come to a conclusion at the end.

6
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:19,320
Now, there are lots of inventories of
the types of data you could gather, but

7
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,210
here's one useful list.

8
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:23,010
One, who are the users?

9
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:26,150
What are their ages, genders,
levels of expertise?

10
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:28,220
Two, where are the users?

11
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:30,260
What is there environment?

12
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:32,880
Number three,
what is the context of the task?

13
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,995
What else is competing for
users' attention?

14
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:37,660
Four, what are their goals?

15
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:40,350
What are they trying to accomplish?

16
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:43,220
Five, right now, what do they need?

17
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:44,730
What are the physical objects?

18
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:45,900
What information do they need?

19
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:48,160
What collaborators do they need?

20
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,050
Six, what are their tasks?

21
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:53,750
What are they doing physically,
cognitively, socially?

22
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:56,350
And seven, what are the subtasks?

23
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:58,410
How do they accomplish those subtasks?

24
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:00,570
When you're designing your
need finding methods,

25
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:03,310
each thing you do should match up
with one or more of these questions.
