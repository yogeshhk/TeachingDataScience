00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:06,810
In this lesson, I've tried to take the various different lists of

2
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:08,850
usability guidelines from different sources

3
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:11,640
and distill them down to a list you can really work with.

4
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:13,830
We combine the lists from Don Norman,

5
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:15,810
from Jakob Nielsen, Larry Constantine,

6
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:20,459
Lucy Lockwood, and the institute for Universal Design into 15 principles.

7
00:00:20,459 --> 00:00:23,720
Now remember, these are just guidelines, principles, and heuristics.

8
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:25,965
None of them are unbreakable rules.

9
00:00:25,965 --> 00:00:29,625
You'll often find yourself wrestling with the tensions between multiple principles.

10
00:00:29,625 --> 00:00:31,965
There will be something cool you'll want to implement but

11
00:00:31,965 --> 00:00:34,580
only most expert users will be able to understand it,

12
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:37,170
or there might be some new interaction method you want to test

13
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:40,685
but you aren't sure how to make it visible or learnable to the user.

14
00:00:40,685 --> 00:00:43,490
These principles are things you should think about when designing.

15
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:45,280
But they only get you so far.

16
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,629
You still do need finding, prototyping,

17
00:00:47,629 --> 00:00:51,220
and evaluation to find out what actually works in reality.
