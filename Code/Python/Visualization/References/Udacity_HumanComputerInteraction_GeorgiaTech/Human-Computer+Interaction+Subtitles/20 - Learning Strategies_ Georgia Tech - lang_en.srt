1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:01,944
Within the full course at Georgia Tech,

2
00:00:01,944 --> 00:00:05,270
there are a number of other strategies
in which you'll engage as well.

3
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:08,170
First, we're really passionate about
leveraging the student community in

4
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:11,220
this class to improve the experience for
everyone.

5
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:13,800
Taking this class with you are people
with experience in a variety of

6
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:17,800
industries, many of whom have
significant experience in HCI.

7
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:21,020
So some strategies we'll use include
peer learning, collaborative learning,

8
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:23,325
learning by teaching, and
communities of practice.

9
00:00:23,325 --> 00:00:26,002
You'll learn both from each other and
with each other.

10
00:00:26,002 --> 00:00:28,920
You'll play the role of student,
teacher, and partner, and

11
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,110
you will learn from each perspective.

12
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:31,630
In addition,

13
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:35,360
the entire course is built around
the idea of project-based learning.

14
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,970
Early in the semester, you'll form
a team and start looking at a problem

15
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:41,530
we've selected, or maybe one in
which you're already interested.

16
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:44,720
This project will then become the domain
through which you explore the principles

17
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:47,540
and methods of
human-computer interaction.

18
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:48,940
Who knows?
By the end of the semester,

19
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:51,730
you might even generate something
with the potential to go forward

20
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:53,860
as a real-world product,
or as a research project.
