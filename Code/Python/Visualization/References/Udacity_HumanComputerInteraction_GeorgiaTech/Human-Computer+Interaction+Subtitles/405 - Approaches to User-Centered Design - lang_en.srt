1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
At a minimum, user-centered design advocates

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,030
involving users throughout the process through surveys,

3
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:07,380
and interviews, and evaluations,

4
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:09,255
and more things that we've already talked about.

5
00:00:09,255 --> 00:00:11,745
However, user-centered design can be taken to

6
00:00:11,745 --> 00:00:15,585
even greater extremes through a number of approaches beyond what we've covered.

7
00:00:15,585 --> 00:00:18,270
One is called participatory design.

8
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:20,730
In participatory design, all the stakeholders,

9
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:22,695
including the users themselves,

10
00:00:22,695 --> 00:00:25,155
are involved as part of the design team.

11
00:00:25,155 --> 00:00:26,710
They aren't just a source of data.

12
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:29,250
They're actually members working on the design team,

13
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:30,690
working on the problem.

14
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:35,775
That allows the user perspective to be pretty omnipresent throughout the design process.

15
00:00:35,775 --> 00:00:38,340
Now, of course, there's still a danger there.

16
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:40,070
Generally, we are not our user.

17
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:41,520
But in participatory design,

18
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,740
one of the designers is the user,

19
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:45,330
but they're not the only user.

20
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:47,925
So, it's a great way to get a user's perspective,

21
00:00:47,925 --> 00:00:52,600
but we must also be careful not to overrepresent that one person's view.

22
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,605
A second approach is action research.

23
00:00:55,605 --> 00:00:57,860
Action research is a methodology that addresses

24
00:00:57,860 --> 00:01:02,540
an immediate problem and researches it by trying to simultaneously solve it.

25
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:05,450
Data gathered on the success of the approaches and used to

26
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:09,304
inform the understanding of the problem and future approaches.

27
00:01:09,304 --> 00:01:12,130
Most importantly, like participatory design,

28
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:15,470
action research is undertaken by the actual users.

29
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:18,800
For example, a teacher might engage in action research by trying

30
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:22,085
a new activity in his classroom and reflecting on the results,

31
00:01:22,085 --> 00:01:24,620
or a manager might use action research by trying

32
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:28,735
a new evaluation system with her employees and noting the changes.

33
00:01:28,735 --> 00:01:32,145
A third approach is design-based research.

34
00:01:32,145 --> 00:01:34,850
Design-based research is similar to action research

35
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:37,300
but it can be done by outside practitioners as well.

36
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:40,660
It's especially common in learning sciences research.

37
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:43,190
In design-based research, designers create

38
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:47,360
interventions based on their current understanding of the theory and the problem,

39
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,700
and they use the success of those interventions

40
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:52,780
to improve our understanding of the theory or the problem.

41
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:55,530
For example, if we believed a certain intersection

42
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:58,394
had a lot of jaywalkers because the signs have poor visibility,

43
00:01:58,394 --> 00:02:01,135
we might interview people at the intersection for their thoughts,

44
00:02:01,135 --> 00:02:04,775
or we could create a solution that assumes that we're correct,

45
00:02:04,775 --> 00:02:08,615
and then use it to evaluate whether or not we actually were correct.

46
00:02:08,615 --> 00:02:12,155
If we create a more clearly visible sign and it fixes the problem,

47
00:02:12,155 --> 00:02:15,545
then it suggests that our initial theory was correct.

48
00:02:15,545 --> 00:02:17,315
Now, in all of these approaches,

49
00:02:17,315 --> 00:02:19,910
notice iteration still plays a strong role.

50
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:22,325
We never try out one design and stop.

51
00:02:22,325 --> 00:02:23,795
We run through the process,

52
00:02:23,795 --> 00:02:25,640
create a design, try it out,

53
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,655
iterate, and improve on it.

54
00:02:27,655 --> 00:02:29,880
Interface design is never really done.

55
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:32,750
It just gets better and better as time goes on

56
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:36,460
while also adjusting to new trends and new technologies.
