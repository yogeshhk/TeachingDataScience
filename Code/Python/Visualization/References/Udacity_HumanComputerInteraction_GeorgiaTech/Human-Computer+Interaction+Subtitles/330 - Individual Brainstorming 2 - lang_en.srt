1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,715
So, I'm going to demonstrate this for you real quick.

2
00:00:02,715 --> 00:00:05,040
I'm going to brainstorm ideas for our problem of

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,800
allowing exercisers to consume books and take notes.

4
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:10,350
So, my paper for brainstorming.

5
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:15,190
So, please enjoy this 30-minute video of me sitting here writing at a desk.

6
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:56,310
Here's my list of ideas.

7
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:58,520
As you might be able to tell it gets kind of crazy,

8
00:00:58,520 --> 00:00:59,960
it's all over the place.

9
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:03,320
You can kind of trace through my entire reasoning process on here.

10
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:05,930
So, some of the ideas are somewhat straightforward.

11
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:07,400
I've got voice commands,

12
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:10,280
I've got gestures, I've got voice transcription.

13
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:13,970
I tried to separate it out into feedback methods and also the way

14
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:17,360
the user actually interacts because we could kind of combine those.

15
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,100
Some of these are actually pretty crazy.

16
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:21,230
I've got on skin interface.

17
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:23,870
So, I've seen some prototypes for things that would let you actually just press on

18
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:26,720
your skin to do different kinds of interactions.

19
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,780
I've also got augmented reality like Google Glass.

20
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:31,960
I've got a portable keyboard like twiddler.

21
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:36,140
So, notice that this is kind of a mess. That's a good thing.

22
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:40,520
Lists are fine but chances are a lot of your ideas are related to each other.

23
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:44,300
Notice also that I never crumpled up my piece of paper, I never throw it away.

24
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:46,595
I crossed one thing out. That's because I wrote the wrong word.

25
00:01:46,595 --> 00:01:49,310
Really at this stage, you don't want to reject any ideas.

26
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:54,030
Your goal is just to kind of free-form brainstorm and get all your thoughts out there.
