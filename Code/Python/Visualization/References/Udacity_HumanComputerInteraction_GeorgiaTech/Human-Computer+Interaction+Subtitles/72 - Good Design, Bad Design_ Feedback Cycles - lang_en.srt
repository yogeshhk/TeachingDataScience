Good design.

A phone that quietly clicks every time
a letter is successfully pressed to

00:00:08,437 --> 00:00:10,470
let you know that the press
has been received.

00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:12,730
Bad design.

The only time you might want your device
to yell a confirmation at you is,

00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:27,280
if you’d just ordered
a nuclear launch or something.
