2
00:00:06,104 --> 00:00:09,920
Today we're going to talk about
mental models and representations.

3
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:12,730
A mental model is the understanding
you hold in your head about

4
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:14,390
the world around you.

5
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:17,150
Simulating a mental model allows
you to make predictions and

6
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:20,630
figure out how to achieve your
goals out in the real world.

7
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:24,460
A good interface will give the user
a good mental model of the system

8
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:26,170
that it presents.

9
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:29,320
In order to develop good medal models we
need to give users good representations

10
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,260
of the system with which
they're interacting.

11
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:31,900
In that way,

12
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:36,140
we can help users learn how to use our
interfaces as quickly as possible.

13
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:39,240
So that's what we'll talk about in this
lesson, creating representations that

14
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:43,280
help users develop accurate
mental models of our systems.

15
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,420
We'll start by talking about
mental models in general and

16
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:48,670
how they apply to the interfaces
with which we're familiar.

17
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:51,240
Then we'll talk about how
representations can make problem

18
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:53,690
solving easier or harder.

19
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:57,240
After that, we'll talk about how
metaphors and analogies can be useful

20
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:01,760
tools to create good representations
that lead to accurate mental models.

21
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:05,349
Then we'll discuss how user error can
arise either from inaccuracies or

22
00:01:05,349 --> 00:01:08,620
mistakes in the user's mental model,
or just from accidental slips,

23
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:10,180
despite an accurate mental model.

24
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:13,900
Finally, we'll close by discussing
learned helplessness, one

25
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:17,410
of the repercussions of poor interface
design, as well as expert blindspot,

26
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:20,070
which is one of the reasons
why poor design can occur.
