Don Norman further divides slips
into two different categories.

2
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:07,545
He describes action-based slips and
memory lapse slips.

3
00:00:07,545 --> 00:00:10,920
Action-based slips are places where
the user performs the wrong action, or

4
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:12,750
performs a right action
on the wrong object,

5
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:15,110
even though they knew
the correct action.

6
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:18,490
They might click the wrong button, or
right-click when they should left-click.

7
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:22,500
A memory lapse slip occurs when the user
forgets something they knew to do.

8
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,580
For example, they might forget
to start a timer on a microwave.

9
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:27,992
They knew what to do,
they just forgot about it.

10
00:00:27,992 --> 00:00:30,680
So action-based slips
are doing the wrong thing, and

11
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:33,560
memory lapse slips are forgetting
to do the right thing.

12
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:36,960
In this dialog,
clicking No when you mean to click Yes

13
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,300
would be an example of
an action-based slip.

14
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:43,180
The very existence of this dialog is
meant to prevent a memory lapse slip,

15
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:45,360
where a user would forget to
save their work before closing.
