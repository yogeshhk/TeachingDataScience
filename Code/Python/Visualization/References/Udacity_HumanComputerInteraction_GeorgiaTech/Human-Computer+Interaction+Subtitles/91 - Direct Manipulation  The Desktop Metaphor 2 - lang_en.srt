1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:03,430
Files and folders on my computer
are meant to mimic files and

2
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:05,480
folders on my physical desk.

3
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:08,480
So we ideally want the action of
moving them around on my computer to

4
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,840
mimic the action of moving them
around on my physical desk.

5
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:13,790
But it wasn't always like this.

6
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:15,870
Before graphical user
interfaces were common,

7
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:19,440
we moved files around using
command line interfaces like this.

8
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:22,267
The folder structure is still
the same on the operating system.

9
00:00:22,267 --> 00:00:25,623
But instead of visualizing
it as folders and icons,

10
00:00:25,623 --> 00:00:29,010
I'm interacting with
a text-based command line.

11
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:30,080
To view the files,

12
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:34,120
I might need to type a command like ls,
which I just have to remember.

13
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:36,820
If I don't remember that command,

14
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:39,600
I don't have much recourse to go find
out what I'm supposed to be doing.

15
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:43,920
To move a file,
I need to type something like this.

16
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,230
I have to type the command,
the file I want to move,

17
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:48,650
and the folder I want to move it to.

18
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:51,830
Again, if I forget the name of that
command, or the order of the parameters

19
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:54,930
to provide, there's not a whole
lot I can to to recover from that.

20
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:56,460
I need to run off to Google and

21
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:58,420
find out what the correct
order of the commands was.

22
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:01,330
Which is actually what I did before
filming this video because I don't

23
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:02,820
actually use the terminal very often.

24
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,686
Then when I execute that command,

25
00:01:05,686 --> 00:01:09,307
there's not a lot of feedback to let me
know if it actually executed correctly.

26
00:01:09,307 --> 00:01:12,290
I might need to change
folders to find out.

27
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:16,190
There I see the files present in
that folder but I had to go and

28
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:17,290
look manually.

29
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:19,800
There's nothing really
natural about this.

30
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:22,700
Now don't get me wrong, once you know
how to interact with this interface,

31
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:24,680
it's very efficient to use.

32
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:27,560
But when you're a novice at it, when
you've never used it before, this is

33
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:32,420
completely unlike the task of managing
physical files on your real desk.

34
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:34,430
Then, the computer mouse came along.

35
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:36,840
And with it came the ability to
move a mouse around the screen.

36
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,190
Equipped with this,
my action in moving files and

37
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:42,390
folders becomes much more direct.

38
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:46,027
I can actually just click
the file I want to move and

39
00:01:46,027 --> 00:01:48,164
drag it into the new folder.

40
00:01:48,164 --> 00:01:51,469
I get instant feedback by the fact
that the file disappeared as soon as I

41
00:01:51,469 --> 00:01:52,317
dragged it over.

42
00:01:52,317 --> 00:01:56,200
And there was a sound effect that you
may or may not have been able to hear.

43
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:59,260
So now instead of typing in some cryptic
command that I just have to be able

44
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:02,070
remember, I can just click on
the file I want to move, and

45
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:04,630
physically drag it to the folder
in which I want to have it.

46
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:08,270
That's a very natural interaction,
it mimics what I do on my physical desk.

47
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:12,690
Moving the mouse around is a lot better
than having to type in those commands,

48
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:16,740
but the gulf of execution and evaluation
are still present, especially for

49
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:17,900
some novice users.

50
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:20,800
There's still some interpretation that
has to happen to understand that when I

51
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,450
move my hand a little left on the mouse,

52
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:25,120
the cursor on screen will
move to the left as well.

53
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,210
And while clicking feels
kind of like grabbing,

54
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:29,120
there's still some interpretation there.

55
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,220
It's more direct than the command line,
but there's still a gap.

56
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:36,660
The modern touchscreens made direct
manipulation more direct than ever.

57
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:39,730
Let's say I want to put an icon
into a folder on my screen.

58
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:40,820
How do I do it?

59
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:43,840
I hold down the icon, and
I drag it to the screen.

60
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,590
The fact that if I wanted to
move something around my desk,

61
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:46,630
I would have to hold it down,

62
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:49,200
means that this is almost
entirely direct manipulation.

63
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,400
I don't need any prior knowledge to
attempt to do what feels natural for

64
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,740
moving that icon into that folder.

65
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:57,820
That gives us a nice,
general heuristic to keep in mind.

66
00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:02,020
How do we help the user interact most
closely with the target of their task?

67
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:05,150
How do we make it so they're
manipulating it as directly as possible?
