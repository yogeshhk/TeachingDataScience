00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:06,490
One of the famous models for communicating is,

2
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:08,065
tell them what you're going to tell them,

3
00:00:08,065 --> 00:00:10,795
tell them, then tell them what you told them.

4
00:00:10,795 --> 00:00:14,814
That's what we've tried to do here at several different levels of abstraction.

5
00:00:14,814 --> 00:00:18,790
At the beginning of the course, we told you the overall structure of the course.

6
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:21,985
Within each unit, we outlined the content of that unit.

7
00:00:21,985 --> 00:00:25,420
Within each lesson, we previewed the content of that particular lesson,

8
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:27,160
and then we delivered the content.

9
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:28,820
Then, we summarized each lesson,

10
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:30,685
and we summarized each unit.

11
00:00:30,685 --> 00:00:33,520
Now, we've summarized the course as a whole.

12
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,505
So, we're done now, right? Not quite.

13
00:00:36,505 --> 00:00:39,100
There are two other useful things to cover,

14
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:43,860
the closely related fields to HCI and where you might want to go next.
