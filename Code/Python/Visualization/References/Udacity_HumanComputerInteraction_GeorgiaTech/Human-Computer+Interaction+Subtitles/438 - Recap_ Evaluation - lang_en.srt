1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,870
The goal of the design lifecycle is to get frequent user feedback

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:08,040
or to put it differently to frequently evaluate our interface ideas.

3
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:12,060
Frequent rapid feedback cycles are important for users of our interface,

4
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:15,150
but they're are also important to us as designers of interfaces.

5
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:18,210
So, that is where evaluation comes into play.

6
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:21,150
Once we've designed an interface whether it's just an idea

7
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:23,740
in our head or a full-fledged working version.

8
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:26,099
It's time to evaluate it with users.

9
00:00:26,099 --> 00:00:27,765
Early on, that may be

10
00:00:27,765 --> 00:00:31,395
qualitative evaluation to get the full picture of the user experience.

11
00:00:31,395 --> 00:00:34,110
Later on, that might be empirical evaluation to

12
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:36,989
more formally capture the results of the interface.

13
00:00:36,989 --> 00:00:40,679
Along the way, we might also employ predictive evaluation

14
00:00:40,679 --> 00:00:44,630
to try to anticipate how users will react to our designs.

15
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:48,170
These methods are the foundation of user-centered design.

16
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:51,920
Design that features frequent user evaluation of our ideas.
