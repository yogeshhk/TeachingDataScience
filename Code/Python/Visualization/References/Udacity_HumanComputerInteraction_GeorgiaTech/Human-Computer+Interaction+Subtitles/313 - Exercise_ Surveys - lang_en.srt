1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,690
Writing survey questions is an art,
as well as a science.

2
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:07,160
So let's take a look at an intentionally
poorly designed survey, and

3
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:09,450
see everything we can find
that's wrong with it.

4
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:10,560
So on the left is a survey.

5
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:12,960
It's kind of short,
mostly because of screen real estate.

6
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,750
Write down in the box on the right
everything that is wrong with

7
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:16,990
this survey.

8
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:19,170
Feel free to skip forward if you
don't want to listen to me read

9
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:21,010
out the questions.

10
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:22,920
On a scale of 1 to 4
with 1 meaning a lot and

11
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:26,770
4 meaning not at all,
how much do you enjoy exercising?

12
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:28,200
Why do you like to exercise?

13
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:32,040
On a scale of 1 to 6 with
1 meaning not at all and

14
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:35,310
6 meaning a lot,
how much do you like audiobooks?

15
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:37,140
Have you listened to
an audiobook this year?
