1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:01,490
So here are my answers.

2
00:00:01,490 --> 00:00:04,900
First when we're talking about things
that are revisable during interaction,

3
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:07,680
we're talking about things that
I as the experimenter can get

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,970
feedback from my user and
immediately change my prototype.

5
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:13,160
So if they say that that button
label doesn't really makes sense,

6
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:15,800
I can cross out that button label and
immediately change it.

7
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:18,720
That makes sense for
prototypes that are very low fidelity.

8
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,670
Verbal prototypes,
I can immediately say okay,

9
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:22,730
then let's make it the way
you just described.

10
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:25,230
Paper prototypes or card prototypes,
I could quickly erase or

11
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:28,050
cross out something on my prototype and
change it.

12
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:29,010
Wizard of Oz is similar.

13
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:31,160
Since I'm running what's
going on behind the scenes,

14
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:33,400
I can just change
the way I'm running it.

15
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:34,350
Those four prototypes,

16
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:38,380
because they're more low fidelity,
also disguises superficial details.

17
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:41,120
No one is going to look at
a prototype that I drew by hand and

18
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,690
say they don't like the font.

19
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:45,020
No one is going to to listen to me
run a Wizard of Oz prototype for

20
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:49,030
a voice interface and say, I don't
like the voice that you're using.

21
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:51,950
These help us focus on the overall
patterns of interaction and

22
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:55,140
disguise some of the superficial
elements that users would often have

23
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:56,800
a tendency to get distracted by.

24
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,110
However, as we prototype,

25
00:00:58,110 --> 00:01:01,880
we need to move from designing
interfaces to designing interactions.

26
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:04,709
Verbal prototypes and paper prototypes
don't really cover interactions,

27
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:07,000
they cover showing something and
asking the user what they think,

28
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,620
but they don't really
go further than that.

29
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:10,280
Card prototypes,

30
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:13,440
Wizard of Oz prototypes, to a certain
extent wireframing and to a certain

31
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:18,010
extent physical prototypes all let us
actually simulate the user interaction.

32
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:20,430
With a card prototype,
we're actually saying if you did that,

33
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:23,900
then you would see this, so they can
walk through the pattern of interaction.

34
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:26,190
Wizard of Oz,
we can simply call out or describe or

35
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:30,210
simulate, this is what would happen
if you do what you just described.

36
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:33,005
Now, wifeframing you could do more like
a paper prototype, where it's just

37
00:01:33,005 --> 00:01:36,775
a simple wire frame, but more generally,
we use wire frames when we're ready to

38
00:01:36,775 --> 00:01:40,695
actually show different interfaces and
the movement between them.

39
00:01:40,695 --> 00:01:41,995
Similarly with physical prototypes,

40
00:01:41,995 --> 00:01:45,565
the main reason why we would do
a physical prototype is to hand a user,

41
00:01:45,565 --> 00:01:49,225
and say, pretend you're jogging, or
pretend you're working in your office.

42
00:01:49,225 --> 00:01:51,110
How would this interact with
what you're actually doing?

43
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:53,515
We're simulating the way they
would physically use it.

44
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:57,580
Now among all of these, the wires frames
are really the ones that are most

45
00:01:57,580 --> 00:01:59,800
easily distributable to remote users.

46
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:03,200
You can make an argument that we can
send scans for a paper prototypes but

47
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,180
generally, a paper prototype
isn't just about what's on paper.

48
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:09,794
It's also about the conversations and
descriptions that we're having around it

49
00:02:09,794 --> 00:02:12,345
and asking users what they
think about certain elements.

50
00:02:12,345 --> 00:02:16,295
Whereas a wire frame is more about
a general impression that users get.

51
00:02:16,295 --> 00:02:19,545
You can make the argument that paper
prototypes can be sent easily, as well.

52
00:02:19,545 --> 00:02:23,485
But for me, I would only share
wire frames with remote users.

53
00:02:23,485 --> 00:02:27,190
Now prototyping look and feel is really
just the inverse of disguise and

54
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:28,660
superficial details.

55
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:31,710
Look and feel is really about those
superficial elements that have

56
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:36,090
a significant user impact, but are more
easily modifiable within an overall

57
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:38,390
pattern of functional interaction.

58
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:42,940
So just as the earlier low fidelity
prototypes support disguising details,

59
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:46,310
the later ones support
prototyping look and feel.

60
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:47,990
As computers become more ubiquitous, and

61
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:50,680
users are moving around while
interacting with interfaces more and

62
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:53,680
more, allowing mobility
is really valuable.

63
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,700
Wizard of Oz, since we're just
calling things out to the user,

64
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:58,260
let them move around, and
same with physical prototypes.

65
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:01,154
We can actually hand them to a user and
have them physically interact,

66
00:03:01,154 --> 00:03:02,979
the way they would with
the actual interface
