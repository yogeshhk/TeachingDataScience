1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:03,380
The GOMS model is a human
information processor model so

2
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:06,880
it builds off the processor model
of the human's role in a system.

3
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:09,830
The GOMS model gets it's name from
the four sets of information it

4
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:11,910
proposes gathering about a task.

5
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:14,640
G, stands for
the users Goals in the system.

6
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:18,200
O, stands for the Operators
the user can perform in the system.

7
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:21,520
M stands for the Methods that the user
can use to achieve those goals.

8
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:25,270
And S stands for the Selection rules
that the user uses to choose among

9
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:27,030
different competing methods.

10
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:30,160
So the GOMS Model proposes that
every human interact with the system

11
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,840
has a set of Goals that
they want to accomplish.

12
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:35,570
They have sent methods that they can
choose from to accomplish those goals.

13
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:38,390
Each of those methods is comprise of
a series of Operators that carries

14
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:39,000
out that method.

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,690
And they have some Selection rules
that help them decide what method to

16
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:42,970
use and when.

17
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:45,660
The GOMS model is often
visualized like this.

18
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:48,620
The user starts with some initial
situation, and they have a goal

19
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:51,910
in mind that they want to accomplish,
so they apply their selection of rule to

20
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:54,540
choice between different competing
methods to accomplish that goal.

21
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:58,340
Once they've chosen a method, they
execute that series of operators and

22
00:00:58,340 --> 00:00:59,700
makes that goal a reality
