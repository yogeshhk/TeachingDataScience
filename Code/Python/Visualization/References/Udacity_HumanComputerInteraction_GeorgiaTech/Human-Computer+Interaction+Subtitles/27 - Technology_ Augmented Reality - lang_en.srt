00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:04,590
Virtual reality generally works by
replacing the real world's visual,

2
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:05,600
auditory, and

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:09,590
sometimes even all factory or
kinesthetic stimuli with it's own input.

4
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:12,750
Augmented reality on the other hand,
compliments what you see and

5
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:14,190
hear in the real world.

6
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:17,020
So for example, imagine a headset
like a Google Glass that

7
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:20,220
automatically overlays directions
right on your visual field.

8
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:22,400
If you were driving,
it would highlight the route to take,

9
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,160
instead of just popping
up some visual reminder.

10
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:28,490
The input it provides complements
stimuli coming from the real world,

11
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:30,510
and instead of just replacing them.

12
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:32,310
And that creates some
enormous challenges, but

13
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:35,190
also some really incredible
opportunities as well.

14
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:37,960
Imagine the devices that can integrate
directly into our everyday lives,

15
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:39,620
enhancing our reality.

16
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:42,770
Imagine systems that could, for example,
automatically translate text or

17
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:45,590
speech in a foreign language,
or could show your reviews for

18
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:47,730
restaurants as you walk down the street.

19
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:50,640
Imagine a system that students could
use while touring national parks or

20
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,090
museums, that would automatically
point out interesting information,

21
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:56,760
custom tailored to that
student's own interests.

22
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:59,810
The applications of augmented
reality could be truly stunning, but

23
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:02,030
it relies on cameras to take
input from the world, and

24
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:04,590
that actually raises some
interesting societal problems.

25
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:07,900
There are questions about what
putting cameras everywhere would mean.

26
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:11,130
So keep those in mind when we get to
interfaces and politics, in unit two.
