1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,210
A lot of the principles we talk about
are cases where you might never even

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:04,968
notice if they've been done well.

3
00:00:04,968 --> 00:00:06,640
There are principles
of invisible design,

4
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:10,740
where succeeding allows the user
to focus on the underlying tasks.

5
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:12,340
But constraints are different.

6
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:14,660
Constraints actively stand
in the user's way and

7
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:17,120
that means they've become more visible.

8
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:18,230
That's often a bad thing, but

9
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:20,830
in the case of constraints
it serves the greater good.

10
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:24,620
Constraints might prevent users
from entering invalid input or

11
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:27,270
force users to adopt certain safeguards.

12
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:28,760
So of all the principles
we've discussed,

13
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:30,920
this might be the one you've noticed.

14
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:31,710
So take a second, and think.

15
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:35,160
Can you think of any times you've
encountered interfaces that had

16
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:35,940
constraints in them?
