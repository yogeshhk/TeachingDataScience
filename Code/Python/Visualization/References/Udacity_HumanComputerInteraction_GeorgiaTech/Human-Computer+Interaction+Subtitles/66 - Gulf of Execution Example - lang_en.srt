1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:03,570
Let's take a simple example
of the gulf of execution.

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:06,514
I'm making my lunch, I have my
bowl of chili in the microwave.

3
00:00:06,514 --> 00:00:09,340
My goal is simple, I want to heat it up.

4
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:10,005
How hard is that?

5
00:00:10,005 --> 00:00:12,419
Well, typically when I've
been cooking in the past,

6
00:00:12,419 --> 00:00:14,999
cooking is defined in terms of
the amount of time it takes.

7
00:00:14,999 --> 00:00:18,820
So, in the context of this system, I
specify my intent as to microwave it for

8
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:20,200
one minute.

9
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:22,403
Now what are the actions
necessary to do so?

10
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:31,253
I press Time Cook to enter
the time-cooking mode, I enter the time,

11
00:00:31,253 --> 00:00:32,920
one minute, and I press Start.

12
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:35,580
I didn't press Start just now,
but I would press Start.

13
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:38,220
I specified my intent,
microwave for one minute.

14
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:41,924
I specified my actions, pressing
the right sequence of buttons, and

15
00:00:41,924 --> 00:00:43,377
I executed those actions.

16
00:00:43,377 --> 00:00:45,210
Could we make this better?

17
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:48,100
There were a lot of button presses
to microwave for just one minute.

18
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:51,780
If we think that's a common behavior,
we might be able to make it simpler.

19
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:55,093
Instead of pressing Time Cook one,
zero, zero and Start,

20
00:00:55,093 --> 00:00:56,893
I might just press one and wait.

21
00:00:56,893 --> 00:00:58,031
Watch.

22
00:01:01,151 --> 00:01:05,761
[NOISE] So I've narrowed the gulf of
execution by shrinking the number

23
00:01:05,761 --> 00:01:10,053
of actions required, but
I may have enlarged it by making it more

24
00:01:10,053 --> 00:01:13,170
difficult to identify
the actions required.

25
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:14,471
When I look at the microwave,

26
00:01:14,471 --> 00:01:16,720
Time Cook gives me an idea
of what that button does.

27
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:20,830
So if I'm a novice at this, I can
discover how to accomplish my goal.

28
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:22,230
That's good for the gulf of execution.

29
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:25,920
It's easier to look at the button and
figure out what to do than to have to go

30
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,300
look, read a manual, or anything
like that and find out on your own.

31
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:31,350
But once you know that all
you have to do is press one,

32
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:33,340
that's much easier to execute.

33
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:36,140
That's something nice about this
interface, it caters to both novices and

34
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:40,830
experts, there's a hard and discoverable
way and a short and visible way.

35
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:43,840
But let's rewind all the way back
to the goal I set up initially,

36
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,840
my goal was to heat up my chili.

37
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,900
I specified my intent in terms of the
system as microwaving it for one minute.

38
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:51,750
But was that the right thing to do?

39
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:55,371
After one minute, my chili might not be
hot enough, this microwave actually has

40
00:01:55,371 --> 00:01:58,516
an automatic reheat function that
senses the food's temperature and

41
00:01:58,516 --> 00:02:00,023
stops when the time seems right.

42
00:02:00,023 --> 00:02:03,884
So the best bridge over the gulf of
execution might also involve helping me

43
00:02:03,884 --> 00:02:05,800
reframe my intention.

44
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:09,199
Instead of going to microwave for one
minute, it might encourage me to reframe

45
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:12,510
this as simply heating until ready and
letting the microwave do the rest.
