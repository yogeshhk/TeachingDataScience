00:00:02,690 --> 00:00:06,945
Here are five quick tips for developing GOMS models.

2
00:00:06,945 --> 00:00:10,560
Number one, focus on small goals.

3
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:12,600
We've used some pretty big examples,

4
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:14,640
but GOMS is really designed to work in the context of

5
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:18,000
very small goals like navigating to the end of a document.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,070
You can abstract up from there,

7
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:23,445
but start by identifying smaller moment-to-moment goals.

8
00:00:23,445 --> 00:00:27,180
Number two, nest goals, instead of operators.

9
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:29,145
It's possible to nest goals.

10
00:00:29,145 --> 00:00:31,290
For example, in our GOMS model of navigation,

11
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:33,710
we could develop it further and break the overall task of

12
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:38,105
navigating down to smaller goals like changing lanes or plotting routes.

13
00:00:38,105 --> 00:00:41,600
Operators, however, are the smallest atoms of a GOMS model.

14
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,025
They don't break down any further,

15
00:00:43,025 --> 00:00:46,400
and those must be the actual actions that are performed.

16
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:50,690
Number three, differentiate descriptive and prescriptive.

17
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:53,060
Make sure to identify whether you're building a model of what

18
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:55,545
people do or what you want them to do.

19
00:00:55,545 --> 00:00:58,790
You can build a GOMS model of what people should do with your interface,

20
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:02,450
but you shouldn't trick yourself into thinking that's necessarily what they will do.

21
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:06,220
Number four, assign costs to operators.

22
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:10,825
GOMS was designed to let us make predictions about how long certain methods will take.

23
00:01:10,825 --> 00:01:12,710
The only way we can do that is if we have

24
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:15,635
some measurement of how long individual operations take.

25
00:01:15,635 --> 00:01:18,095
Usually, this is time, but depending on the domain,

26
00:01:18,095 --> 00:01:21,175
we might be interested in phrasing the cost differently as well.

27
00:01:21,175 --> 00:01:25,010
Number five, use GOMS to trim waste.

28
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:27,950
One of the benefits of GOMS is it lets you visualize where

29
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:31,775
an unnecessary number of operators are required to accomplish some task.

30
00:01:31,775 --> 00:01:35,035
That's bolstered by the costs we assign to this operators.

31
00:01:35,035 --> 00:01:37,490
So, use GOMS to identify places where the number of

32
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:40,930
operators required can be simplified by the interface.
