00:00:02,990 --> 00:00:06,645
In this lesson, we've covered a small glimpse of how

2
00:00:06,645 --> 00:00:10,395
HCI can work in a more agile development environment.

3
00:00:10,395 --> 00:00:13,380
In many ways, they're a nice match.

4
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:15,315
Both emphasized feedback cycles,

5
00:00:15,315 --> 00:00:17,610
both emphasize getting user feedback,

6
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:19,890
and both emphasize rapid changes.

7
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:24,675
But while HCI traditionally has done these behind the scenes before reaching real users,

8
00:00:24,675 --> 00:00:27,300
Agile emphasizes doing these live.

9
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:30,060
Now, it's important to note I've only provided

10
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:33,075
a narrow glimpse into what Agile development is all about.

11
00:00:33,075 --> 00:00:37,805
I've discussed how HCI matches with the theory and the goals of Agile development.

12
00:00:37,805 --> 00:00:41,465
But Agile is a more complex suite of workflows and stake holders.

13
00:00:41,465 --> 00:00:45,770
I really recommend reading more about it before you try to take an Agile approach to HCI,

14
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:48,620
or before you try to integrate interaction design into

15
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:51,740
an existing Agile team as you do though,

16
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:55,660
I think you'll notice that there can be a really nice compatibility between the two.
