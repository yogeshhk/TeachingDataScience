1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,850
Ubiquitous computing refers to the trend towards embedding

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:05,640
computing power in more and more everyday objects.

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:08,450
You might also hear it referred to as pervasive computing.

4
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:12,195
It's deeply related to the emerging idea of an Internet of Things.

5
00:00:12,195 --> 00:00:14,580
A few years ago, you wouldn't have found computers,

6
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:16,364
and refrigerators, and wristwatches,

7
00:00:16,364 --> 00:00:18,330
but as microprocessors became cheaper,

8
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:20,580
and as the world became increasingly interconnected,

9
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:23,100
computers are becoming more and more ubiquitous.

10
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,680
Modern HCI means thinking about whether someone might use

11
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,245
a computer while they're driving a car or going on a run.

12
00:00:28,245 --> 00:00:30,630
It means figuring out how to build smart devices

13
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:33,030
that also some of the cognitive load from the user,

14
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:35,220
like refrigerators that track their own contents and

15
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:37,915
deliver advice to the users right at the right time.

16
00:00:37,915 --> 00:00:42,265
This push for increasing pervasiveness has also led to the rise of wearable technologies.

17
00:00:42,265 --> 00:00:43,760
Exercise monitors are probably

18
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,910
the most common examples of this but smartwatches, Google Glass,

19
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:50,420
augmented reality headsets, even things like advanced hearing aids and

20
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:54,290
robotic prosthetic limbs are all examples of wearable technology.

21
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:56,840
This push carries us in the areas usually reserved for

22
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:59,150
human factors engineering and industrial design,

23
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:04,110
which exemplifies the increasing role of HCI in the design of new products.
