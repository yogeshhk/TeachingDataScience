In 1996, Bonnie Nardi edited

2
00:00:06,295 --> 00:00:09,960
a prominent book on study of contexts in human-computer interaction,

3
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:12,405
titled "Context and Consciousness".

4
00:00:12,405 --> 00:00:16,305
The entire book is worth reading but two papers in particular stands out to me,

5
00:00:16,305 --> 00:00:18,000
both by Nardi herself.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,130
The first is a short paper that serves in

7
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:22,485
some ways as an introduction to the book as a whole.

8
00:00:22,485 --> 00:00:24,390
It's not a long paper, only four pages,

9
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:26,595
so I highly recommend reading it, it won't take you long.

10
00:00:26,595 --> 00:00:31,350
Here, Nardi outlines the general application of activity theory to HCI.

11
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:34,590
She notes that activity theory offers a set of perspectives on

12
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:38,450
human activity and a set of concepts for describing that activity.

13
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:41,810
This is exactly what HCI research needs as we struggle to

14
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:45,650
understand and describe context, situation, and practice.

15
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:49,070
She particularly notes that the theory is uniquely suited to addressing

16
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:52,975
some of the interesting issues facing HCI in 1996.

17
00:00:52,975 --> 00:00:56,825
For that reason, it's also fascinating to view from a historical perspective.

18
00:00:56,825 --> 00:01:00,080
Today, we understand the role that context has grown to play,

19
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:01,969
especially with emerging technologies.

20
00:01:01,969 --> 00:01:03,920
It's fascinating to me to look back at how

21
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,010
the community was constructing that debate 20 years ago.
