00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,040
We've discussed repeatedly that HCI is in large part about understanding tasks.

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,654
As designers, we designed tasks that feature interfaces,

3
00:00:08,654 --> 00:00:10,650
not just interfaces alone.

4
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:12,870
To accomplish that, it's important to have

5
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:16,785
a very clear understanding of the task for which we're designing.

6
00:00:16,785 --> 00:00:20,205
So toward that end, we discussed task analysis.

7
00:00:20,205 --> 00:00:23,300
Task analyses are ways of breaking down tasks

8
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:27,130
into formal workflows to aid the design process.

9
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:30,110
So, we covered two general kinds of task analyses.

10
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:33,470
We talked about information processor models like the GOMS model,

11
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:36,740
which focuses on the user's goals, operators, and methods.

12
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:40,205
Those are primarily concerned with what we can observe.

13
00:00:40,205 --> 00:00:43,940
We also talked about cognitive task analysis which tried to get inside

14
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:48,545
the user's head so we can understand the user's thought process during the task as well.

15
00:00:48,545 --> 00:00:54,060
Both of these approaches are valuable to designing good tasks with usable interfaces.
