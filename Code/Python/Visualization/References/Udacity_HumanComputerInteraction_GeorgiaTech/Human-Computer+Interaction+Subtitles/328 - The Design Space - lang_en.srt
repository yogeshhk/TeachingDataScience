1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:03,820
When we talk about the problem we're
solving here we define the problem space

2
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:07,170
as disabling a security
system as we enter a home.

3
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:09,760
We defined our problem as
far as possible away from

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,170
the current interfaces for doing it.

5
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:14,050
The design space on
the other hand is the area

6
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:16,040
in which we design our
solutions to this problem.

7
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:19,850
The current design space for
this problem is wall mounted devices and

8
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:22,120
portable devices like my key chain.

9
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:25,950
But as we design, the space of
possible ideas might expand.

10
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:29,095
For example, as we go along we might
be interested in voice interfaces or

11
00:00:29,095 --> 00:00:32,130
interfaces with our mobile phones or
wearable devices.

12
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:35,600
Our goal during the design alternative
phase is to explore the possible design

13
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:36,210
space.

14
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:39,532
We don't want to narrow down too
early by sticking devices on walls or

15
00:00:39,532 --> 00:00:41,088
devices on keychains.

16
00:00:41,088 --> 00:00:43,522
We want to brainstorm lots
of possible approaches, and

17
00:00:43,522 --> 00:00:45,298
grow a large space of possible designs.
