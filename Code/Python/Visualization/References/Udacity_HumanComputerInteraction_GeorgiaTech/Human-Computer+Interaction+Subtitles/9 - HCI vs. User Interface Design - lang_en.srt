00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:01,435
For many years,

2
00:00:01,435 --> 00:00:04,590
human-computer interaction was
largely about user interface design.

3
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:09,790
The earliest innovations in HCI were the
creation of things like the light pen,

4
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:11,850
the first computer mouse,
which allow for

5
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:14,450
flexible interaction
with things on screen.

6
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:16,940
But the focus was
squarely on the screen.

7
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:21,370
And so, we developed many principles
about how to design things nicely

8
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:22,190
for a screen.

9
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:26,590
We borrowed from the magazine and print
industries and identify the value of

10
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:31,540
grids in displaying content and guiding
the users eyes around our interfaces.

11
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:34,340
We created laws that govern
how difficult it is for

12
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:37,120
users to select what
they want on screen.

13
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,340
We examined for example whether it's
easier to select a menu on a Mac,

14
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:42,520
where the menus are always
at the top of the screen.

15
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:44,880
Or on a PC, where they're grouped
with the individual window.

16
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:47,000
We develop techniques for

17
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,150
helping interfaces adapt to different
screen sizes and we develop methods for

18
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:55,630
rapidly prototyping user interfaces
using pen and paper or wire frames.

19
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:57,080
Through this rich history,

20
00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:00,540
UI design really became its
own well defined field.

21
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:03,230
In fact,
many of the concepts we'll cover in HCI

22
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:06,320
were originally developed in
the context of UI design.

23
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:09,160
But in HCI, we're interested in
things that go beyond the user's

24
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,670
interaction with a single screen.

25
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:15,730
Technically, you an cover that in UI
design as well, but traditionally most

26
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:19,930
of the UI design classes I see
focus on on-screen interaction.

27
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:22,900
In HCI, we'll talk about the more
general methods that apply to

28
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:23,460
any interface.
