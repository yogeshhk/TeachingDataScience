00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:04,560
The first part of this learning outcome
to design needed some definition, but

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:07,280
the second part seems pretty
straightforward, right?

3
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:08,480
Not exactly.

4
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,220
Effectiveness is defined
in terms of our goal.

5
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:13,652
The most obvious goal here
might be usability and for

6
00:00:13,652 --> 00:00:16,591
a lot of that's exactly
what we're interested in.

7
00:00:16,591 --> 00:00:17,940
If I'm designing a new thermostat,

8
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:22,080
I want the user to be able to create the
outcome they want as easily as possible.

9
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,640
But maybe usability isn't my goal,
maybe it's research.

10
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:28,229
Maybe I'm interested in investigating
what makes people think that

11
00:00:28,229 --> 00:00:30,320
the thermostat is working correctly.

12
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,050
In that case, I might deliberately
create some thermostats that are harder

13
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:37,160
to read, just to see how that changes
people's perceptions of the system.

14
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:40,950
Or it could be that my goal isn't to
make the certain activity easier but

15
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:43,090
rather to change that activity.

16
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:45,940
Maybe I'm interested in reducing
a home's carbon footprint.

17
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:49,100
In that case, my goal is to get
people to use less electricity.

18
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:51,740
I might design the interface of
the thermostat specifically to encourage

19
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:53,540
people to use less.

20
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:56,120
Maybe I'd show them a comparison
to their neighbor's usage, or

21
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:58,000
allow them to set energy usage goals.

22
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,380
Or I could make the thermostat
physically harder to turn up and down.

23
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:05,379
So effectiveness is very much determined
by the goal that I have in mind.

24
00:01:05,379 --> 00:01:08,600
We'll generally assume that our goal is
usability, unless we state otherwise.

25
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,910
But we'll definitely talk about
some of those other goals as well.
