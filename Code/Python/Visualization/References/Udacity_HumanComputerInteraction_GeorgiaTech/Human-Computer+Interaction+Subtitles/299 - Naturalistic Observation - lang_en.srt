1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:02,120
For certain tasks, a great way for

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:05,720
us to understand the users
need is to simply watch.

3
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:06,315
A great way for

4
00:00:06,315 --> 00:00:09,689
me to start understanding what it's like
to need an audiobook app for exercising

5
00:00:09,689 --> 00:00:13,027
is to come somewhere where people are
exercising and just watch them exercise.

6
00:00:13,027 --> 00:00:15,535
This is called naturalistic observation,

7
00:00:15,535 --> 00:00:18,430
observing people in
their natural context.

8
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:21,110
So I'm fortunate that I actually live
across the street from a park, so

9
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:25,290
I can sit here in my rocking chair on my
porch and just watch people exercising.

10
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:27,540
Now, I want to start with very
specific observations and

11
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:30,190
then generalize out to
more abstract tasks.

12
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:32,790
That way I'll observe something
called confirmation bias which is

13
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:36,930
basically when you see what you
want to see, so what do I notice?

14
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:39,160
Well, I notice that there's a lot
of different types of exercisers.

15
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:42,870
There are walkers, joggers,
runners I see some rollerbladers,

16
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:44,030
I see some people doing yoga.

17
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:46,180
I see a lot of people riding bikes but

18
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:48,950
the bikers seem to be broken into
two different kinds of groups.

19
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:51,090
I see a lot of people biking
kind of leisurely but

20
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:54,220
I also see some bikers who are a little
bit more strenuous about it.

21
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:56,620
I'm also noticing that while
joggers might be able to stop and

22
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:59,300
start pretty quickly, that's harder for
someone riding a bike.

23
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:01,840
So I might want to avoid
designs that force the user to

24
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,960
pull out their phone a lot because
that's going to be dangerous and

25
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,280
awkward for people riding bikes.

26
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:09,250
Now I also see people
exercising in groups and

27
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:11,230
also people exercising individually.

28
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:12,870
For those people exercising in groups,

29
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:14,910
I don't actually know if
they'd be interested in this.

30
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:16,909
Listening to something might
kind of defeat the purpose of

31
00:01:16,909 --> 00:01:17,732
exercising together.

32
00:01:17,732 --> 00:01:20,057
So I'm going to have to note that
down as a question I want to ask

33
00:01:20,057 --> 00:01:21,450
people later.

34
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:23,460
I also see that many people
tend to stretch before and

35
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:26,730
after exercising and
I'm wondering if we can use that.

36
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:29,140
Then we can have some kind of starting
and ending sequence for this, so

37
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:32,180
that a single session is kind of
book ending by both stretching, and

38
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:33,790
interacting with our app.

39
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:36,526
Note that by just watching people
engage in the task of exercising,

40
00:01:36,526 --> 00:01:39,751
I'm gathering an enormous amount of
information that might affect my design.

41
00:01:39,751 --> 00:01:43,101
But note also, that while
naturalistic observation is great,

42
00:01:43,101 --> 00:01:45,220
I'm limited ethically in what I can do.

43
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:48,620
I can't interact with users directly and
I can't capture identifying information

44
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:52,270
like videos and photographs that's why I
can't show you what I'm seeing out here.

45
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:54,890
I'm also limited in that I don't
know anything about what those users

46
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:55,920
are thinking.

47
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,870
I don't know if the people working
out in groups would want to be

48
00:01:57,870 --> 00:02:00,270
able to listen to audiobooks
while they're doing yoga.

49
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:02,330
I don't know if bluetooth
headsets would be problematic for

50
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:06,630
people riding bike, I need to do a lot
more before I get to the design phase.

51
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:10,110
But this has been very informative in my
understanding of the problem space and

52
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:12,170
giving me things I can
ask people later on.
