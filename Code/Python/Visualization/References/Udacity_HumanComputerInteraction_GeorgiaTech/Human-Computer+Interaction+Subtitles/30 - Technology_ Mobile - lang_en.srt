00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,270
One of the biggest changes to computing over the past several years

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:06,555
has been the incredible growth of mobile as a computing platform.

3
00:00:06,555 --> 00:00:08,580
We really live in a mobile first world,

4
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:11,325
and that introduces some significant design challenges.

5
00:00:11,325 --> 00:00:13,440
Screen real estate is now far more limited.

6
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:14,940
The input methods are less precise,

7
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:16,620
and the user is distracted.

8
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:20,699
The mobile computing also presents some really big opportunities for HCI.

9
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:22,080
Thanks in large part to mobile,

10
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,215
we're no longer interested just in a person sitting in front of a computer.

11
00:00:25,215 --> 00:00:29,025
With mobile phones, most people have a computer with them at all times anyway.

12
00:00:29,025 --> 00:00:33,220
We can use that to support experiences from navigation to stargazing.

13
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:37,085
Mobile computing is deeply related to fields like context-aware computing,

14
00:00:37,085 --> 00:00:39,560
ubiquitous computing, and augmented reality as it

15
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:42,530
possesses the hardware necessary to complement those efforts.

16
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:46,780
But even on its own, mobile computing presents some fascinating challenges to address.

17
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:49,670
For me, the big one is that we haven't yet reached a point where we can

18
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:52,535
use mobile phones for all the tasks we do on computers.

19
00:00:52,535 --> 00:00:54,590
Smart phones are great for social networking,

20
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:57,080
personal organization, games, and lots of other things.

21
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:59,690
But we haven't yet reached a point where the majority of people would

22
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:02,750
sit down to write an essay or do some programming on smartphones.

23
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:05,840
Why haven't we? What do we need to do to make smart phones into

24
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,480
true replacements for traditional desktop and laptop computers?
