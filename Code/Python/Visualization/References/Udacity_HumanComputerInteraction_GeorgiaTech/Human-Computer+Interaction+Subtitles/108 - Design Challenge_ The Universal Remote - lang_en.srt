00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:03,910
For this design challenge, let's
tackle one of the most common problems

2
00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:08,810
addressed in undergraduate HCI classes,
designing a better remote control.

3
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:10,760
Now, these probably aren't
very good interfaces.

4
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:13,060
And that's not to say that
they're poorly designed, but

5
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:15,470
the constraints on how many
different things they have to do and

6
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:19,420
how limiting the physical structure
can be, make these difficult to use.

7
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:21,960
You might have seen humorous
images online of people putting

8
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:24,790
tape over certain buttons on the
controls to make them easier to use for

9
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:26,750
their parents or their kids.

10
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:30,380
How would we design an invisible
interface for universal remote control,

11
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:32,650
one that doesn't have the learning
curves that these have?
