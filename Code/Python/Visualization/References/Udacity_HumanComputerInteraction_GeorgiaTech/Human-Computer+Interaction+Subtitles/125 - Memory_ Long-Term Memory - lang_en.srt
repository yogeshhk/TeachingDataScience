1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:02,915
Finally, we have long-term memory.

2
00:00:02,915 --> 00:00:06,330
Long-term memory is a seemingly
unlimited store of memories, but

3
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:08,180
it's harder to put something
into long-term memory,

4
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:10,140
than to put it into short-term memory.

5
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:12,690
In fact,
to load something into long-term memory,

6
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:15,560
you generally need to put it into
short-term memory several times.

7
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:17,460
To demonstrate this,

8
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:20,260
I'm going to describe something
called lightner system.

9
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:23,340
The lightner system is a way
of memorizing key value pairs,

10
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:26,070
or in other words memorizing flashcards.

11
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:28,280
Those can be words and
their definitions, countries and

12
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:31,950
their capitals, laws and their formulas,
anything where you're given a key and

13
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:32,970
asked to return a value.

14
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:36,090
So I have some flashcards here that
have the capitals of the world.

15
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:39,960
What I do is go through each one,
read the country,

16
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:41,800
check to see if I remember the capital.

17
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:44,661
And if I do,
I'll put it in the pile on the right.

18
00:00:44,661 --> 00:00:47,091
I read the country and
don't know the capital,

19
00:00:47,091 --> 00:00:48,923
I'll put it in the pile on the left.

20
00:00:48,923 --> 00:00:50,139
So let me do that real quick.

21
00:00:50,139 --> 00:00:58,681
[MUSIC]

22
00:00:58,681 --> 00:01:02,140
Now tomorrow, I will just go
through the pile on the left.

23
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:04,250
Any that I remember from
the pile on the left tomorrow,

24
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:06,200
I'll move to the pile on the right.

25
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:09,140
Any that I still don't remember,
will stay in the pile on the left.

26
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:12,490
So I'm focusing my attention on
those that I don't yet know.

27
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:14,920
In four days,
I'll go through the pile on the right.

28
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:18,390
And any that I don't remember then,
I'll move back to my pile on the left,

29
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:20,610
to remind me to go
through them each day.

30
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:23,960
So the things that I remember least,
are most often loaded in the short-term

31
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:27,190
memory, solidifying them
in my long-term memory.

32
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:30,040
Now in practice, you wouldn't just do
this with two piles, you'd do a three,

33
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,360
or four, or five.

34
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,130
And the long restoration pile you'd
might only go through yearly,

35
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:35,530
just to see if it's decayed yet.
