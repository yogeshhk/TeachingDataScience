1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:03,950
Most commonly in HCI, we're interesting
in designing for usability.

2
00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:06,311
We want to make tasks
easier through technology.

3
00:00:06,311 --> 00:00:09,876
So in a car, we might be interested in
designing a GPS that can be used with

4
00:00:09,876 --> 00:00:11,227
the fewest number of taps.

5
00:00:11,227 --> 00:00:16,360
Or a dashboard that surfaces the most
important information at the right time.

6
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:18,720
Sometimes we're also interested in
designing for research, though.

7
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,680
We might design a dashboard that
includes some kind of visualization

8
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,620
of the speed to see if that changes
the way the person perceives how fast

9
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:26,970
that they're going.

10
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:30,320
But a third motivation is to
somehow change the user's behavior.

11
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,760
Designing for change in response
to some value that we have.

12
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:36,980
Often times that may actually conflict
with those other motivations.

13
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:39,530
If we're trying to discourage
an unhealthy habit,

14
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:42,720
we might want to make the interface for
that habit less usable.

15
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:46,220
Cars actually have a lot of interfaces
created with that motivation in mind.

16
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:49,440
If I started driving without
a seatbelt on, my car will beep at me.

17
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,150
Some cars will cap your
speed at a certain number.

18
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:54,810
Those interfaces serve
no usability goals but

19
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:57,170
rather they serve
the goal of user safety.

20
00:00:57,170 --> 00:00:59,083
Now, that's a simplistic example, but

21
00:00:59,083 --> 00:01:01,800
it shows what I call
the three goals of HCI.

22
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:06,930
Help a user do a task, understand how
a user does a task, or change the way

23
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:10,410
a user does a task due to some value
that we hold, like safety or privacy.
