00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:08,850
Every possible application of HCI involves users completing some sort of task.

2
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:11,250
That task might be something within a domain.

3
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:12,960
In educational technology, for example,

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,035
at that task might be learning how to do a certain kind of problem.

5
00:00:16,035 --> 00:00:18,060
If your area is more technological,

6
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:21,390
the task might be something that the user is doing through your application like

7
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:25,725
using virtual reality and gesture recognition to sculpt the virtual statue.

8
00:00:25,725 --> 00:00:28,770
Take a moment and try to think of the kinds of tasks you

9
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:32,040
might be interested in exploring in your chosen application area.

10
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:35,660
Did they lend themselves more to an information processor model like gums,

11
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:40,790
or to cognitive models like hierarchical task analysis and how can you tell?
