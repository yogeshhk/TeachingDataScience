1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,920
As you can now see,
the score was 0 to 0.

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:05,756
Now, as you tried to reason over that,

3
00:00:05,756 --> 00:00:08,439
what you probably did was
picture the image in your mind.

4
00:00:08,439 --> 00:00:11,575
That was trying to reason over what was
stored in the perceptual buffer, and

5
00:00:11,575 --> 00:00:12,668
it decayed very quickly.

6
00:00:12,668 --> 00:00:15,120
However, if you're a fan of baseball,

7
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,550
you probably had a better
chance of getting that right.

8
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:19,653
That's because you have
some domain expertise.

9
00:00:19,653 --> 00:00:22,902
You're better able to process images
about that domain more quickly.

10
00:00:22,902 --> 00:00:26,702
You might, for example, have recognized
that most of the innings weren't marked.

11
00:00:26,702 --> 00:00:30,260
So that increases the odds that
the score of the game was pretty low.

12
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:34,350
This idea is actually the foundation of
a fascinating study about chess experts

13
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:37,902
versus novices and recognizing
the configuration of chess boards.

14
00:00:37,902 --> 00:00:41,102
The study found that experts were far
better than novices at remembering

15
00:00:41,102 --> 00:00:44,355
realistic chess boards that were only
flashed for a short period of time,

16
00:00:44,355 --> 00:00:46,330
like the one on the left.

17
00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:50,780
But experts were no better than novices
at remembering random chessboards.

18
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:54,690
So expertise, or rehearsal, delays
the decay of the perceptual buffer.
