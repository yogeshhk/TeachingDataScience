00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,090
The feedback cycle in HCI is reliant on a relationship

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:06,315
between the users input and the interface's output.

3
00:00:06,315 --> 00:00:08,610
The idea of this cycle is that the user learns from

4
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:11,025
the output what they should have input.

5
00:00:11,025 --> 00:00:13,080
If they do something that causes an error,

6
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,765
they receive feedback on how to avoid that next time.

7
00:00:15,765 --> 00:00:17,145
If they do something correctly,

8
00:00:17,145 --> 00:00:19,455
then they see that their goal was accomplished.

9
00:00:19,455 --> 00:00:21,270
That's the principle of feedback.

10
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:22,740
But what happens when there's

11
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:26,240
no discernible interaction between the input and the output?

12
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,800
What happens when there's a break in this cycle?

13
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,510
What happens when the user acts in the system over and over and over again,

14
00:00:32,510 --> 00:00:35,270
but never receives any output that actually helps?

15
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:37,370
What if they never even receive output that indicates that

16
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:40,315
the computer is understanding them or receiving input from them?

17
00:00:40,315 --> 00:00:43,270
That's when something called learned helplessness sets in.

18
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:45,365
The human working with the interface

19
00:00:45,365 --> 00:00:48,725
learns that they're helpless to actually use the system.

20
00:00:48,725 --> 00:00:53,480
They learn that there is no mapping between their input and the output they receive.

21
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:55,610
As a result, they believe that there's

22
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:58,700
just nothing they can do to accomplish their goals.

23
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:00,260
No one wants to feel that way.

24
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:02,420
No one wants to feel like no matter what they do,

25
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:03,725
they are doomed to failure.

26
00:01:03,725 --> 00:01:05,570
No one wants to feel like they're failing at

27
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:08,050
something that everyone else seems to do very easily.

28
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:09,950
So, it's very natural for people to develop

29
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:12,750
this resistance to even try and to learn about this interface.
