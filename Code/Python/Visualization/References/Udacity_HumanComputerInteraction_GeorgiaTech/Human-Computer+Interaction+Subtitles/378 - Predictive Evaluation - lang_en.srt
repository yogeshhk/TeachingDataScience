1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,075
Predictive evaluation is evaluation
we can do without actual users.

2
00:00:04,075 --> 00:00:08,990
Now, in user centered design that's not
ideal, but predictive evaluation can be

3
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:12,270
more efficient and
accessible than actual user evaluation.

4
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:15,510
So it's all right to use it as
part of a rapid feedback process.

5
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:17,430
It lets keep the user in mind,

6
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:20,470
even we we're not bringing
users into the conversation.

7
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:23,820
The important thing is to make
sure we're using it appropriately.

8
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:26,980
Predictive evaluation shouldn't be used
where we could be doing qualitative or

9
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:28,640
empirical evaluation.

10
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,520
It should only be used where we wouldn't
otherwise be doing any evaluation.

11
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,220
Effectively, it's better than nothing.
