00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:03,630
In order for us to really sympathize
with users suffering from the effects of

2
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:06,500
learned helplessness and
expert blind spot, it's important for

3
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:09,350
us to understand what it's
like to be in that position.

4
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:11,260
We've all experienced these
things at some point in life,

5
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:14,685
although at the time, we might not
have understood what was happening.

6
00:00:14,685 --> 00:00:15,855
So take a second and

7
00:00:15,855 --> 00:00:18,825
reflect on a time when you
experienced learned helplessness and

8
00:00:18,825 --> 00:00:23,015
the effects of expert blind spot from
someone trying to teach you something.

9
00:00:23,015 --> 00:00:26,395
It might have been in a class, it might
be learning a new skill, or it might be

10
00:00:26,395 --> 00:00:29,445
doing something that everyone else seems
to do just fine day to day, but for

11
00:00:29,445 --> 00:00:31,365
whatever reason,
you've always struggled with.
