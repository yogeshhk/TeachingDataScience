1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:03,400
In this lesson we've covered a wide
variety of different methods for

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:04,700
need finding.

3
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:08,170
Each method has its own
disadvantages and advantages.

4
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:11,770
So let's start to wrap up the lesson
by exploring this with an exercise.

5
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:15,870
Here are the methods we've covered,
and here are the potential advantages.

6
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:17,884
For each row, for each advantage,

7
00:00:17,884 --> 00:00:21,523
mark which need-finding method
actually has that advantage.

8
00:00:21,523 --> 00:00:23,662
Note that these might be
somewhat relative, so

9
00:00:23,662 --> 00:00:25,770
your answer may differ from ours.

10
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:27,940
Go ahead and skip to the exercise
if you don't want to listen to me

11
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:29,270
read these out.

12
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:32,439
The columns from left to right
are Naturalistic Observation,

13
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:36,750
Participant Observation,
Errors and Hacks, Interviews,

14
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:41,820
Surveys, Focus Groups,
Apprenticeship, and Think-Aloud.

15
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:46,210
The potential advantages are Analyzes
data that already exists,

16
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:50,290
Requires no recruitment,
Requires no synchronous participation,

17
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:55,360
Investigates the participant's thoughts,
occurs within the task context, and

18
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,160
cheaply gathers lots of users' data.
