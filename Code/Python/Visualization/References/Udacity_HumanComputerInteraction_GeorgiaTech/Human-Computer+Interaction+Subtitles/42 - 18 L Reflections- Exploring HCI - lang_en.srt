1
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:06,030
Throughout our conversations, we're going to explore some of

2
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:08,670
the fundamental principles and methods of HCI.

3
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:11,030
Depending on the curriculum surrounding this material,

4
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:12,740
you'll complete assignments, projects,

5
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:15,360
exams, and other assessments in some of these design areas.

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:19,630
However, we'd also like you to apply what you learned to an area of your choice.

7
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:21,240
So, pick an area.

8
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,970
Either one we've mentioned here or one you'd like to know about separately,

9
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:26,235
and keep it in mind as we go through the course.

10
00:00:26,235 --> 00:00:28,410
Our hope is that by the end of the course,

11
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:29,790
you'll be able to apply what you learn

12
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:32,680
here to the area in which you're interested in working.
