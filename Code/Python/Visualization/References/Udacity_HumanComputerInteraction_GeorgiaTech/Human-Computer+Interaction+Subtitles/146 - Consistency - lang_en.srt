00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,150
Consistency is a principle from Norman, Nielsen,

2
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:07,350
and Constantine and Lockwood that refers to using controls, using visualizations,

3
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:11,280
using layouts, using anything we use in our interface design consistently,

4
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,895
across both the interfaces that we design and what we design more broadly as a community.

5
00:00:15,895 --> 00:00:19,180
Norman writes a consistency in design is virtuous.

6
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:20,495
It's a powerful word there.

7
00:00:20,495 --> 00:00:24,455
It means that lessons learned with one system transfer readily to others.

8
00:00:24,455 --> 00:00:27,770
If a new way of doing things is only slightly better than the old,

9
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:29,239
it's better to be consistent.

10
00:00:29,239 --> 00:00:31,310
Of course, there'll be times when new ways of

11
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:33,740
doing things will be significantly better than the old,

12
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:36,275
and that's how we actually make progress. It's how we advance.

13
00:00:36,275 --> 00:00:39,125
But if we're only making tiny little iterative improvements,

14
00:00:39,125 --> 00:00:41,150
it might be better to stick with the old way of doing

15
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:43,010
things because users are used to it.

16
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:44,750
They're able to do it more efficiently.

17
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:48,560
Nielsen writes that users should not have to wonder whether different words,

18
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:50,960
situations or actions mean the same thing.

19
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,895
Follow platform conventions.

20
00:00:52,895 --> 00:00:56,840
In other words, be consistent with what other people have done on the same platform,

21
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:58,690
in the same domain, and so on.

22
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:02,425
Constantine and Lockwood describe consistency as reuse.

23
00:01:02,425 --> 00:01:06,625
They say the design should reuse internal and external components and behaviors,

24
00:01:06,625 --> 00:01:11,180
maintaining consistency with purpose rather than merely arbitrary consistency.

25
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:14,545
Thus reducing the need for users to rethink and remember.

26
00:01:14,545 --> 00:01:16,940
That means that we don't have to be consistent with things that don't

27
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:19,100
really impact what the user knows to do.

28
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:20,895
The color of the window, for example,

29
00:01:20,895 --> 00:01:23,060
isn't going to change whether the user understand what

30
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:25,610
the word copy means in the context of an interface.

31
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:28,610
But changing the word copy to duplicate might force

32
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:31,810
users to actually rethink and remember what that term means.

33
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:34,370
In some cases, that might be a good thing if duplicate

34
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:36,770
actually does something slightly different than copy,

35
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:38,480
then changing that would force our users to

36
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,445
understand that they're doing something different.

37
00:01:40,445 --> 00:01:41,915
But if we're doing the same thing,

38
00:01:41,915 --> 00:01:45,170
it's important to maintain consistency so the user doesn't have to think as

39
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:49,220
much and can focus on the task at hand instead of on our interface.

40
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:53,660
The general idea across all of these is we should be consistent both within and across

41
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:55,670
interfaces to minimize the amount of

42
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:58,255
learning the user needs to do to learn our interface.

43
00:01:58,255 --> 00:02:01,040
In this way, we create affordances on our own.

44
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,350
Unlike traditional physical affordances,

45
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:06,920
there's no physical reason for the interface to be designed a certain way.

46
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:09,230
But by convention, we create expectations for

47
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:12,590
users and then fulfill those expectations consistently.

48
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:14,450
One great example of following

49
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:18,425
these conventions are the links we use in text on most websites.

50
00:02:18,425 --> 00:02:20,690
For whatever reason, an early convention on

51
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:23,420
the Internet was for links to be blue and underlined.

52
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:27,450
Now when we want to indicate to users that some text is clickable, what do we do?

53
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:30,300
Generally, we might make it blue and underline it.

54
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:32,190
Sometimes we change this as you can see here.

55
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:35,390
Underlining has actually fallen out of fashion in a lot of places and now we

56
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:39,020
just use the distinct text color to indicate a link that can be clicked.

57
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:41,645
On some other sites, the color itself might be different.

58
00:02:41,645 --> 00:02:45,040
It might be red against blue text instead of blue against black.

59
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:49,135
But the convention of using a contrasting color to mark links has remained,

60
00:02:49,135 --> 00:02:52,505
and the most fundamental convention is still blue underlines.

61
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:55,130
Again there's no physical reason why links need to be

62
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:58,015
blue or why they even need to be a different text color at all.

63
00:02:58,015 --> 00:03:02,030
But that convention helps users understand how to use our interfaces.

64
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:05,690
If you've used the Internet before and then visit Wikipedia for the first time,

65
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:08,320
you understand that these are links without even thinking about it.

66
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,520
Most of the interfaces we designed will have

67
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:13,240
a number of functions in common with other interfaces.

68
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,170
So, by leveraging the way things have been done in the past,

69
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:18,380
we can help users understand our interfaces more quickly.

70
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:21,380
Other common examples of consistency and interface design would include

71
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:24,230
things like using consistent hotkeys for things like copy,

72
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:25,600
paste and select all.

73
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,990
Ordering the Menus, File, Edit, View,

74
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:31,400
etc, putting options like save and open under File.

75
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,770
We don't even begin to think about these things when we're using

76
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:37,160
an interface until we encounter one that defies our conventions,

77
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:41,555
and yet someone has to consciously decide to be consistent with established norms.

78
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:44,150
This is an example of design becoming invisible.

79
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:45,500
When people do it right,

80
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,210
we don't notice they did it at all.

81
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:49,775
When people put those options in the right places,

82
00:03:49,775 --> 00:03:52,910
we don't even think about it, but when people put them in the wrong places,

83
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:54,940
it's pretty jarring and startling.
