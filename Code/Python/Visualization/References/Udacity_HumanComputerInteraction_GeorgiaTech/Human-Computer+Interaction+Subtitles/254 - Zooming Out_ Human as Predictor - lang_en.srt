1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,390
For the most part, we're interested
in something more task-focused.

2
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:06,830
In fact, this is where we'll likely
spend the majority of our time.

3
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:10,050
This is the user interacting through
some interface to accomplish some task.

4
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:13,220
That's what we mean by
the predictor model of the user.

5
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:16,720
The user is actively involved in looking
at the task, making predictions about

6
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:19,300
what to do, and making predictions
about what will happen.

7
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:22,870
This is where we looked at the gulf of
execution and the gulf of evaluation.

8
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:25,010
How hard is is for
the user to interact with a task?

9
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:28,520
And how hard is it for them to get
feedback on their interaction?

10
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:31,530
Here we also look at how the interface
can ideally disappear from this

11
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:34,440
interaction, making the user feel like
they're working directly with the task,

12
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,470
not interacting with an interface.

13
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:38,950
Now, many of our design principles
are constructed specifically to

14
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:39,980
help with this.

15
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:42,440
To help users more quickly make
sense of the interface, and

16
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:44,650
understand the underlying task.

17
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:47,694
But in order to design this interaction
effectively, we have to understand

18
00:00:47,694 --> 00:00:50,130
the way the user thinks about
the task they're performing.

19
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:52,230
We have to understand
their mental models and

20
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:56,040
in turn, we have to help make sure their
mental models match the actual task.

21
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:59,620
Here we have to get into questions like
understanding the user's errors and

22
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:02,270
understanding the mapping
between representations and

23
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:04,000
the understanding tasks.

24
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,260
We also have to address questions
like expert blind spot and

25
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:07,530
learned helplessness.

26
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:10,370
Now, fortunately,
we have a tool to help us with this.

27
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:14,580
Cognitive task analysis and
its related hierarchical task analysis.

28
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:18,510
So much of what we deal with in HCI
occurs within this process of a human

29
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:20,430
completing a task
through some interface.
