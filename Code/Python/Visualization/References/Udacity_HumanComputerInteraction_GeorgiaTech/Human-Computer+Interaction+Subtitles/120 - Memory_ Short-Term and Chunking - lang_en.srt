00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:01,935
When we're designing interfaces,

2
00:00:01,935 --> 00:00:05,240
short-term memory is one
of our biggest concerns.

3
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:08,295
It's important we avoid requiring
the user to keep too much stored in

4
00:00:08,295 --> 00:00:10,270
short-term memory at a time.

5
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:14,070
Current research shows that users can
really only store four to five chunks

6
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:16,020
of information at a time.

7
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:18,900
For a long time, there was a popular
idea that people could store seven,

8
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:21,340
plus or minus two,
items in memory at a time.

9
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:24,150
But more recent research suggests that
the number is really four to five

10
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:25,430
chunks.

11
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:28,490
There are two principals we need
to keep in mind here though.

12
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:31,360
The first, is the idea of chunking.

13
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:34,410
Chunking is grouping together
several bits of information into

14
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:35,960
one chunk to remember.

15
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:38,110
So to illustrate this, let's try it out.

16
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:40,920
I'm about to show you six
combinations of letters.

17
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:44,630
Try to memorize them and then enter
them into the exercise that pops up.

18
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:45,262
Are you ready?

19
00:00:56,563 --> 00:00:59,682
Now to keep you from just rehearsing it
in your perceptual store until you can

20
00:00:59,682 --> 00:01:02,905
reenter it, I'm going to stall and
show you some pictures of my cats.

21
00:01:02,905 --> 00:01:04,114
There's one.

22
00:01:04,114 --> 00:01:06,535
There's both of them,
and here's my daughter.

23
00:01:06,535 --> 00:01:08,305
Okay, now fill in the words.
