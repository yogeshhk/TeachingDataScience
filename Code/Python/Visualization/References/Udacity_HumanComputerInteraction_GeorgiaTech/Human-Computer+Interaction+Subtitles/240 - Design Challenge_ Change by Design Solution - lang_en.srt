1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:01,900
So here's one idea.

2
00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:05,650
Imagine a weather tracking app that
crowdsourced weather monitoring.

3
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:08,920
Every hour participants are buzzed to go
outside and let their phone take some

4
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:11,620
temperature readings,
maybe take a picture of the sky.

5
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:14,630
That design has nothing at all
to do with moving around, but

6
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:16,329
that's the side effect of it.

7
00:00:16,329 --> 00:00:19,280
Participation in this
seemingly unrelated activity

8
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:21,360
has the benefit of
getting people moving.

9
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:24,510
Pokemon GO is a great example
of this in a different context.

10
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:28,130
It doesn't spark the same kind of
intermittent exercise but it gets people

11
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:32,090
to exercise more generally, all without
ever actually telling them to do so.
