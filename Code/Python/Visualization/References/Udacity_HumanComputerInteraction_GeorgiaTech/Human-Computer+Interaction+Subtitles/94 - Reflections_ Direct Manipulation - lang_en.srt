1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:01,540
Take a moment real quick and

2
00:00:01,540 --> 00:00:04,410
reflect on some of the tasks you
perform with computers day-to-day.

3
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:07,370
What are some of the places
where you don't interact through

4
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:08,780
direct manipulation?

5
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:11,670
If you're having trouble thinking of
one, think especially about places where

6
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:14,910
technology is replacing things
you used to do manually.

7
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:15,440
Chances are,

8
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:19,210
the physical interface was a bit closer
to the task than the new technical one.

9
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:21,870
How can the technical interface
better leverage direct manipulation?
