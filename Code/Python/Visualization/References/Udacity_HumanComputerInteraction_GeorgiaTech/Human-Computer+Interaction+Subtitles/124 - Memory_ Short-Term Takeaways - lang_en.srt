1
00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:03,000
So what are the implications
of short term memory for HCI?

2
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:06,570
We don't want to ask the user to
hold too much in memory at a time,

3
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:08,540
four to five chunks is all.

4
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:11,250
Asking the user to hold ten numbers
in short term memory, for example,

5
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:12,300
would probably be too much.

6
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:16,210
But we can increase the user's effective
short term memory capacity by helping

7
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:17,470
them chunk things.

8
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:20,390
For example, this is probably
by far easier to remember,

9
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:22,180
even though it's the same content.

10
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:23,610
We've shrunk ten items into three.

11
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:24,910
And we've used a format for

12
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:28,250
phone numbers with which you're probably
familiar if you're in the United States.

13
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:29,450
If you're from outside the U.S.,

14
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:31,220
you might be familiar with
a different grouping.

15
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:33,470
But the same principle applies.

16
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:37,370
And finally, when possible, we should
leverage recognition over recall.

17
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:40,010
For example, if I ask you to recite
the number, maybe you could.

18
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:41,320
In fact, go ahead.

19
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:42,072
Try it.

20
00:00:44,362 --> 00:00:47,002
Whether or not you could do that,
you almost certainly, though,

21
00:00:47,002 --> 00:00:48,680
can pick it from this list.

22
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:51,220
This is one of the reasons why
menu bars and tool strips are so

23
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:53,010
ubiquitous in software design.

24
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:55,350
The user doesn't have to remember
the icon for a command or

25
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:56,267
the name of an option.

26
00:00:56,267 --> 00:00:57,890
They just have to recognize
it when they see it.
