1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,560
We can take the GOMS model and apply
it to a number of different domains.

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:07,480
So let's take the example of needing
to communicate a message to a coworker.

3
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:08,863
We have an initial situation,

4
00:00:08,863 --> 00:00:11,426
which is the need to transfer
information to a coworker.

5
00:00:11,426 --> 00:00:14,545
That carries with it the implicit
goal of the information having been

6
00:00:14,545 --> 00:00:15,252
transferred.

7
00:00:15,252 --> 00:00:17,240
We might have a number of
different methods in mind for

8
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:18,043
how we could do that.

9
00:00:18,043 --> 00:00:20,940
We could email them, we could walk
over and talk to them in person.

10
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:23,720
And we also have some selection
rules that dictate how we choose

11
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:25,170
amongst these methods.

12
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:28,320
If what we need to transfer is very
time-sensitive, maybe we walk over and

13
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,500
talk to them in person or
call them on the phone.

14
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:33,090
If the information we need
to transfer is complex and

15
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:35,210
detailed, maybe we write them an email.

16
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:37,630
Or if it's more casual,
maybe we chat with them or text them.

17
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:39,850
No matter what method we choose,

18
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:43,230
we then execute the series of operators
that carries out that method, and

19
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:47,250
the result is our goal is accomplished,
the information has been transmitted.

20
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:49,850
Or we could also take
the problem of navigation.

21
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:52,332
Our initial situation is the need
to get to our destination,

22
00:00:52,332 --> 00:00:55,458
which carries with it the implicit goal
of having reached our destination.

23
00:00:55,458 --> 00:00:57,818
We might have different methods,
like take the scenic route,

24
00:00:57,818 --> 00:01:00,890
take the highway route, take the surface
streets, and some selection rules that

25
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:03,294
might say something like,
when it's rush hour on the highway,

26
00:01:03,294 --> 00:01:06,800
take surface streets, or if it's not
time sensitive, take the scenic route.

27
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:09,766
After choosing, we execute those
operators and reach our goal.

28
00:01:09,766 --> 00:01:12,355
So in this way,
GOMS models capture our goals,

29
00:01:12,355 --> 00:01:15,465
our different methods for
carrying out those goals, and

30
00:01:15,465 --> 00:01:18,990
the individual operators that
we use to execute those methods.
