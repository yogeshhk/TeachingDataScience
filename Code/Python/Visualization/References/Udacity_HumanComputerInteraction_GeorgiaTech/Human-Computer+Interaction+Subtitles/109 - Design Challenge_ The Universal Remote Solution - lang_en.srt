00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:04,180
Personally I think this is a great
candidate for a voice interface.

2
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:07,230
And in fact, Comcast,
Amazon and others have

3
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:10,340
already started experimenting with
voice interfaces for remote controls.

4
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:12,740
One of the challenges with voice

5
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:16,340
interfaces is that generally
the commands aren't very discoverable.

6
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:20,350
Generally, if you don't know what you
can say, you have no way of finding out.

7
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:23,790
But watching TV and movies is such a
normal part of our conversations that we

8
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:27,745
already have a vocabulary of
how to say what we want to do.

9
00:00:27,745 --> 00:00:28,995
The challenge is for

10
00:00:28,995 --> 00:00:32,865
us designers to make a system that
can understand that vocabulary.

11
00:00:32,865 --> 00:00:37,245
That way when I say, watch Community, it
understands that Community is a TV show

12
00:00:37,245 --> 00:00:39,745
and it tries to figure out,
do I grab it from the DVR,

13
00:00:39,745 --> 00:00:41,975
do I grab it from On Demand,
do I see if it's on live?

14
00:00:41,975 --> 00:00:45,441
The vocabulary for
the user was very natural.

15
00:00:45,441 --> 00:00:49,733
So for example, watch Conan.

16
00:00:49,733 --> 00:00:53,647
>> Well tonight, a fan named
David Joiner thinks he caught a mistake.

17
00:00:53,647 --> 00:00:58,600
He says it happened when I was telling
a joke recently about Rand Paul.

18
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,821
>> Hey Conan, I was watching
your episode on April 17th, and

19
00:01:01,821 --> 00:01:04,616
you said that Rand Paul
wanted to run for president.

20
00:01:04,616 --> 00:01:05,870
>> I had to put that in there somewhere.
