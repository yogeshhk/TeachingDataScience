1
00:00:00,458 --> 00:00:02,110
During these need-finding exercises,

2
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:05,520
you'll have gathered an enormous amount
of information about your users.

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,210
Ideally, you've combined different
sets of these approaches.

4
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:10,360
You've observed people
performing the tasks,

5
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:14,400
you've asked them about their thought
process, and you tried it some yourself.

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,408
Pay special attention to some of the
places where the data seem to conflict.

7
00:00:18,408 --> 00:00:21,670
Are these cases where you as
the designer understand some elements of

8
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:23,620
the task that the users don't?

9
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:26,740
Or are these cases where your expertise
hasn't quite developed to the point of

10
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:28,680
understanding the task?

11
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:30,990
Once you've gone through
the data gathering process,

12
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:34,800
it's time to revisit that inventory of
things we wanted to gather initially.

13
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,630
One, who are the users?

14
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:38,600
Two, where are the users?

15
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:41,530
Three, what is the context of the task?

16
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:43,630
Four, what are their goals?

17
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:46,840
Five, right now, what do they need?

18
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:48,890
Six, what are their tasks?

19
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:51,510
And seven, what are the subtasks?

20
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:54,340
Revisit these, with the results
of your data gathering in mind.
