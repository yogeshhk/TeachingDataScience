1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,740
Positive change doesn't always
have to happen by design though.

2
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:06,650
In fact there are numerous examples
of positive change happening more

3
00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:11,440
as a bi-product of technological
advancement rather than as a goal of it.

4
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:15,720
In Bijker's, of Bicycles, Bakelites and
Bulbs, this is the bicycle example.

5
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:17,870
The story looks at what
women can do before and

6
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:19,760
after the invention of the bicycle.

7
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,210
Before the bicycle, women tend
to be pretty reliant on men for

8
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:24,700
transportation.

9
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:27,480
People generally got around with
carriages, which were pretty expensive,

10
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,910
so only wealthy people would own them.

11
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:31,710
And so, typically men would own them.

12
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:34,450
So if a woman wanted to go to
a restaurant or go to a show,

13
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:37,630
she typically had to go either with
her spouse or with her father.

14
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:40,968
As a result, society rarely
saw women acting individually.

15
00:00:40,968 --> 00:00:44,140
They were usually in the company of
whoever the prominent male in their life

16
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:45,565
was at the time.

17
00:00:45,565 --> 00:00:47,615
But then the bicycle came along.

18
00:00:47,615 --> 00:00:50,935
The bicycle was affordable enough and
targeted at individuals, so

19
00:00:50,935 --> 00:00:53,055
now women could get around on their own.

20
00:00:53,055 --> 00:00:54,645
So now a woman could go to a show or

21
00:00:54,645 --> 00:00:59,195
go to a restaurant by herself,
instead of relying on a man to take her.

22
00:00:59,195 --> 00:01:02,115
In the book though,
what Bijker covers is not just the fact

23
00:01:02,115 --> 00:01:04,795
that this enabled more
individual transportation, but

24
00:01:04,795 --> 00:01:08,260
rather that this enabled
a profound social shift.

25
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:12,110
This technological innovation allowed
women to start acting independently.

26
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:14,320
And it also demanded a wardrobe change,

27
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:17,560
interestingly enough, because you
couldn't wear a dress on a bicycle.

28
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:21,230
So the invention of the bicycle
simultaneously changed women's' attire,

29
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:25,170
and changed the level of independence
they could show in modern society.

30
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:30,150
And both these changes force society
to challenge traditional gender roles.

31
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:32,933
The bicycle's role in
women's liberation was so

32
00:01:32,933 --> 00:01:36,975
significant that Susan B Anthony
actually once said, I think bicycling

33
00:01:36,975 --> 00:01:40,703
has done more to emancipate women
than anything else in the world.

34
00:01:40,703 --> 00:01:44,269
But when the bicycle was invented, it's
doubtful that the inventor sat down and

35
00:01:44,269 --> 00:01:46,839
said surely this will be a great
way to emancipate women and

36
00:01:46,839 --> 00:01:48,530
change our culture's gender roles.

37
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:50,410
That's not what they had in mind.

38
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:52,680
They were inventing
a technological device.

39
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,400
But as an unintended
positive side effect,

40
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:58,900
that technological device
profoundly changed society.
