00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:04,230
One of the most exciting parts of
HCI is it's incredible ubiquity.

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:07,140
Computers are all around us and
we interact with them everyday.

3
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:09,310
It's exciting to think about
designing the types of tools and

4
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:13,862
interfaces we spend so much time dealing
with, but there's a danger here too.

5
00:00:13,862 --> 00:00:15,740
Because we're all humans
interacting with computers,

6
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:18,470
we think we're experts at
human-computer interaction.

7
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:20,330
But that's not the case.

8
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:23,200
We might be experts at interacting with
computers, but that doesn't make us

9
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:27,520
experts at designing interactions
between other humans and computers.

10
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:30,560
We're like professional athletes or
world-class scientists.

11
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,840
Just because we're experts doesn't mean
we know how to help other people also

12
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,250
become experts.

13
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:38,180
In my experience,
many people look at HCI like this.

14
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:39,850
The red dot represents
what they know and

15
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:42,800
the black circle represents what
they think there's to know.

16
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,350
They know there's probably somethings
they don't know yet, but they're

17
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:48,540
already pretty at it, and it wouldn't
be too hard to become an expert.

18
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:51,760
After studying HCI for a bit though,
they look more like this.

19
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,780
You can see that they've
increased what they know but

20
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:57,250
their perception of what there
is to know has grown even more.

21
00:00:57,250 --> 00:00:59,330
That's the journey we'll
be taking together.

22
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:02,430
You'll learn to do work in HCI,
but perhaps more importantly,

23
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:05,730
you'll learn how complex and
large the field of HCI is.

24
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:08,820
Your knowledge will increase,
but yet you might exit the class

25
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:11,680
less confident in your HCI
ability than when you started.

26
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,930
You're taking the first
step into a larger world.
