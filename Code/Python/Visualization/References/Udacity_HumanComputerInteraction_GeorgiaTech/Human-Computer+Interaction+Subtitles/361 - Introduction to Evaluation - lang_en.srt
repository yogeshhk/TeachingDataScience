2
00:00:06,001 --> 00:00:08,679
The heart of user-centered
design is getting

3
00:00:08,679 --> 00:00:10,744
frequent feedback from the users.

4
00:00:10,744 --> 00:00:13,720
That's where evaluation comes into play.

5
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:16,140
Evaluation is where we take
what we've designed and

6
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:18,940
put it in front of users
to get their feedback.

7
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:21,850
But just as different prototypes serve
different functions at different stages

8
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:24,620
of the design process,
so also our methods for

9
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:27,000
evaluation need to match as well.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,910
Early on,
we want more qualitative feedback.

11
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:32,640
We want to know what they like, what
they don't like, whether it's readable,

12
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,450
whether it's understandable.

13
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:36,630
Later on,
we want to know if it's usable.

14
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:38,310
Does it actually minimize your workload?

15
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:39,030
Is it intuitive?

16
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:40,810
Is it easy to learn?

17
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:44,470
Then at the end, we might want to
know something more quantitative.

18
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:47,180
We might want to actually measure, for
example, whether the time to complete

19
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:51,150
a task has changed, or whether
the number of sales has increased.

20
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:54,070
Along the way, we might also want
to iterate even more quickly

21
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:56,880
by predicting what the results
of user evaluation will be.

22
00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:00,810
The type of evaluation we
employ is tightly related to

23
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:03,100
where we are in our design process.

24
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:05,300
So in this lesson,
we'll discuss the different methods for

25
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:08,560
performing evaluation to get
the feedback we need when we need it.
