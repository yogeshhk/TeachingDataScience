1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:01,000
At this point,

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,980
there's a risk of a major misconception
that we should cut off right now.

3
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:08,420
We started with need finding, then
develop some design alternatives, and

4
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:09,620
now we're prototyping.

5
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:12,530
We've talked about how prototyping
follows a timeline to low fidelity

6
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:15,940
to high fidelity prototypes,
from early to late prototyping.

7
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:20,300
We might think that we move on to
evaluation when we're done prototyping.

8
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:22,960
That's not the way the design
life cycle works though.

9
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,830
We go through this cycle several
times for a single design and

10
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:30,650
a single prototype corresponds to
a single iteration through the cycle.

11
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:33,990
So we did some initial needfinding,
we brainstormed some alternatives, and

12
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:36,410
we prototyped those
alternatives on paper.

13
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:39,380
We don't jump straight from doing them
on paper to doing them via wire framing

14
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:40,970
or doing a functional prototype.

15
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:44,860
We take those prototypes and
we use them for evaluation.

16
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:48,160
We evaluate those paper
prototypes with real people.

17
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:51,300
The results of that evaluation
tell us if we need to go back and

18
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:53,410
understand the task even better.

19
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:56,150
Those results help us reflect
on our alternatives as a whole,

20
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:58,210
maybe come up with some new ones.

21
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:02,120
Then, equipped with the results of that
evaluation, that additional needfinding,

22
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:06,240
and that additional brainstorming,
we return to the prototyping phase.

23
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,180
If our prototype seemed to
be pretty successful and

24
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:10,970
pretty sound, then maybe it's
time to raise the fidelity of it.

25
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:14,060
Maybe we take it from a paper prototype
and actually do some wire frames, or

26
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:16,900
do a car prototype around
the actual interaction.

27
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:18,310
If it wasn't very successful though,

28
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:21,830
when we reach back here, we're going
to do a different paper prototype, or

29
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:25,780
a different low fidelity prototype,
and then go to evaluation again.

30
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:28,720
Each time we develop a new prototype
we go through the same cycle again.

31
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,170
Now that might sound extremely slow and

32
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:35,330
deliberate but we also go through this
on a very different time scales too.

33
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:37,270
So for example,
after we've gone through needfinding and

34
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:40,740
designing alternative brainstorming,
we can develop a paper prototype.

35
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:43,090
We give it to a user and
get their evaluation.

36
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:44,580
They say that they don't like it.

37
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:45,390
We ask them why,

38
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:48,900
we ask them to describe what about their
task isn't supported by that interface.

39
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:51,150
That's in some ways
another needfinding stage.

40
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:53,430
Then we brainstorm real quick
how we could resolve that.

41
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:55,980
Maybe we just do that while
we're sitting with that user and

42
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:59,610
think it didn't support this element
of what they described, but I could add

43
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:03,340
that pretty quickly just by making this
button or this function more visible.

44
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:06,350
Now we very quickly have a new
prototyping just by sketching out that

45
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:09,669
addition to that paper prototype and
now we can do it again.

46
00:02:09,669 --> 00:02:11,360
This cycle could take one minute.

47
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,430
We could take one prototype, put it in
front of a user, get their evaluation,

48
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:18,720
figure out what they liked and didn't
like, brainstorm a way to fix that, and

49
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,310
then immediately revise it and
try it again.

50
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:22,940
We can go through this very,
very quickly.

51
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:24,510
We could also go through
this very slowly,

52
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:27,200
we could have prototypes
that take months to develop.

53
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,220
And generally that's why we only want
to do that after we've gone through

54
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:31,550
the cycle a few times.

55
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:34,510
Because if we're going to take months
to develop a prototype, we want to

56
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:37,570
make sure we're probably going to get
some pretty good evaluations on it.

57
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:40,530
And we can make sure of that by
prototyping the elements in lower

58
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:41,490
fidelity first.
