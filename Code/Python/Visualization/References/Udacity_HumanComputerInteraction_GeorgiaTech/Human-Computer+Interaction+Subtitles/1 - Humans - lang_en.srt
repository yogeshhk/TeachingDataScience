This is Morgan.

00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:09,200
>> Hello.

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,160
>> Morgan is a human.

5
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:13,100
>> Last time I checked.

00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:16,910
>> As a human, Morgan has various ways
of perceiving the world around her,

7
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:19,370
like seeing, hearing, and feeling.

8
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:21,480
>> Is anyone else seeing these?

00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,960
>> There area few more as well
like smelling and tasting,

10
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,470
but we won't deal with those as much.

00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,520
>> Thank goodness.

12
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:31,050
>> But Morgan has more than senses.

13
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:34,360
She also has memories,
experiences, skills, knowledge.

14
00:00:36,415 --> 00:00:36,915
>> Thanks.

15
00:00:38,005 --> 00:00:41,335
>> In human computer interaction,
we have to take into consideration every

16
00:00:41,335 --> 00:00:44,525
element of the human, from the way they
perceive and interact with the world,

17
00:00:44,525 --> 00:00:47,015
to their long history of using
computers and technology.
