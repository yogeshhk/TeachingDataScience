00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:03,780
One of my favorite examples of
an interface that is invisible by design

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:06,310
comes from a video game called Portal 2.

3
00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:09,550
In lots of video games, you use
a control stick to control the camera in

4
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:11,960
game, but different people
have different preferences for

5
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:13,630
how the camera should behave.

6
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:15,950
Some feel if you press up,
you should look up.

7
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:18,665
Others like myself, feel if you
press down you should look up,

8
00:00:18,665 --> 00:00:21,370
more like you're controlling
an airplane with a joystick.

9
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:24,060
In most games you have to set this
manually by going to options,

10
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:26,100
selecting camera controls,
and enabling or

11
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:29,680
disabling a y axis and
it's just a chore.

12
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:32,768
But in portal two, watch what happens.

13
00:00:32,768 --> 00:00:34,630
>> You will here a buzzer.

14
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:36,637
When you hear the buzzer,
look up at the ceiling.

15
00:00:36,637 --> 00:00:39,343
[SOUND] Good.

16
00:00:39,343 --> 00:00:40,810
You will hear a buzzer.

17
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:43,045
When you hear the buzzer,
look down at the floor.

18
00:00:43,045 --> 00:00:45,977
[SOUND] Good.

19
00:00:45,977 --> 00:00:49,063
This completes the gymnastic portion
of your mandatory physical and

20
00:00:49,063 --> 00:00:50,350
mental wellness exercise.

21
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:52,960
>> Did you see that?

22
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,400
It was so subtle you might
not have even noticed it.

23
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,130
A character in the game
asked me to look up.

24
00:00:57,130 --> 00:01:00,360
The game assumed whichever
direction I pressed

25
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:02,850
was the way I would want to
press when I want to look up.

26
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:04,750
And set my preference accordingly.

27
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:07,050
No option screen, no changing settings.

28
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:08,230
The game automatically and

29
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:11,950
invisibly had me complete my goal of
correctly setting my camera preference.
