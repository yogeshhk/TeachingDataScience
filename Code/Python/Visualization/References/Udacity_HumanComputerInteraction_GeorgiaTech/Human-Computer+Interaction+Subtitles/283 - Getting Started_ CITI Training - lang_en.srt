1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,060
If you're going to be doing a research
just part of a University project or

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:06,150
University class, you need IRB approval.

3
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:08,119
Different universities have
different processes and

4
00:00:08,119 --> 00:00:10,380
policies for getting started with IRB.

5
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:13,240
We're going to discuss the Georgia Tech
policies and sets where these class is

6
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:16,590
based but you should check with your
university if you're from somewhere else

7
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:19,820
to make sure you're following
the right policies for your school.

8
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:22,880
To get started, we need to
complete the required training.

9
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,640
So here I'm showing the IRB website,

10
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,660
which is
researchintegrity.gatech.edu/irb.

11
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:30,640
And to get started, you need to
complete your required training.

12
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,980
So click required training
over on the left.

13
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:36,440
This'll take you to a page that
overviews the IRB required training and

14
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:39,380
gives you a link of the left
to begin your CITI training.

15
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:43,080
So click that,
then login to your Georgia Tech account.

16
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:47,920
And you're going to want to
complete Group 2, Social and

17
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,800
Behavioral Research Investigators and
Key Personnel.

18
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,400
I can't show you exactly what it looks
like to sign up fresh because I've

19
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,560
already completed it.

20
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:57,740
But you should be able to add
a course and add that as your course.

21
00:00:57,740 --> 00:01:00,550
After you've completed CITI training
you'll receive your completion report

22
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:02,840
and then you'll be ready
to get started with IRB.
