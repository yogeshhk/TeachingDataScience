1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:01,740
When we talk about feedback cycles,

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:05,160
we talk about how they're ubiquitous
across nearly every field.

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:06,880
And each CI itself, isn't any different.

4
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:09,810
In a feedback cycle,

5
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:13,460
the user does something in
the interface to accomplish some goal.

6
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:16,395
And then judges based on
the output from the interface,

7
00:00:16,395 --> 00:00:20,025
whether the goal was accomplished,
then they repeat and continue.

8
00:00:20,025 --> 00:00:21,831
In HCI, we're brainstorming and

9
00:00:21,831 --> 00:00:24,204
designing interfaces
to accomplish goals.

10
00:00:24,204 --> 00:00:27,193
And then based on the output of our
evaluations, we judge whether or

11
00:00:27,193 --> 00:00:29,868
not the goals of the interface
were actually accomplished,

12
00:00:29,868 --> 00:00:31,780
then we repeat and continue.

13
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:35,140
In many ways, we're doing the same
things that our users are doing,

14
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:38,700
trying to understand how to
accomplish a task in an interface.

15
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:42,380
Only in our case,
our interface is the tools to build and

16
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:47,180
evaluate interfaces and our goal is
to help them accomplish their goal.
