1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:02,480
Whether through using
direct manipulation,

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:04,850
through innovative approaches
to shrinking these gulfs or

3
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:08,270
through the user's patience and
learning, our ultimate goal is for

4
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:12,730
the interface between the user and
the task to become invisible.

5
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:16,070
What this means is that even though
there is an interface in the middle,

6
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:18,460
the user spends no
time thinking about it.

7
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:21,660
Instead, they feel like they're
interacting directly with the task

8
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:23,600
rather than with some interface.

9
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,760
So for example, I have a stylus and I'm
going to write on this tablet computer.

10
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,210
I'm interacting with an interface
just translating my drawing

11
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:38,480
into data in the system.

12
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,609
But for me, this feels just like
I'm writing on a normal page.

13
00:00:45,922 --> 00:00:48,050
That feels just like writing on paper.

14
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:49,880
This interface between me and

15
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:54,410
the data representation of my drawing
underneath is pretty much invisible.

16
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:55,480
I feel like I'm writing on paper.

17
00:00:56,710 --> 00:00:59,508
Contrast that with trying
to draw with a mouse.

18
00:01:06,603 --> 00:01:09,060
That feels extremely unnatural.

19
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:12,524
I'm very well aware of the mouse as
the interface between myself and

20
00:01:12,524 --> 00:01:13,568
this drawing task.

21
00:01:13,568 --> 00:01:17,728
So the direct manipulation facilitated
by the stylus gets me much closer to my

22
00:01:17,728 --> 00:01:20,608
task and helps the interface
disappear between me and

23
00:01:20,608 --> 00:01:22,400
what I'm trying to accomplish.
