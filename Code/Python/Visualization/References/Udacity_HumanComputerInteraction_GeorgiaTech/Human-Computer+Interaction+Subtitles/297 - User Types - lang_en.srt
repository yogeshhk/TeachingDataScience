1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,390
Just as we want to get an idea of the physical space of the problem,

2
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:06,150
we also want to get an idea of the space of the user.

3
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:09,190
In other words, we want to understand who we're designing for.

4
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:12,330
That comes up a lot when doing design alternatives and prototyping,

5
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:14,490
but we also want to make sure to gather information about

6
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:16,920
the full range of users for whom we're designing.

7
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:21,215
So, let's take the example of designing an audiobook app for people that exercise.

8
00:00:21,215 --> 00:00:24,320
Am I interested in audiobooks just for kids or for adults too?

9
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,690
Am I interested in experts who are exercising or novices at it?

10
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:30,090
Am I interested in experts listening to audiobooks?

11
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:32,160
Or am I interested in novices at that as well?

12
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:33,950
Those are pretty key questions.

13
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:37,560
They differentiate whether I'm designing for business people who want to be able to

14
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:39,030
exercise while reading or

15
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:42,030
exercisers who want to be able to do something else while exercising.

16
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:43,815
The task is similar for both,

17
00:00:43,815 --> 00:00:45,779
but the audience, their motivations,

18
00:00:45,779 --> 00:00:47,400
and their needs are different.

19
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:50,060
So, I need to identify these different types of users and

20
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:52,790
perform need-finding exercises on all of them.

21
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:54,440
One of the most successful products of all times

22
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:56,990
exceeded because of the tension to user types.

23
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:59,510
The Sony Walkman became such a dramatic success because

24
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:02,510
they identified different needs for different types of people,

25
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:05,080
design their product in a way that it met all those needs,

26
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:08,705
but then they marketed specifically to those different types of individuals.

27
00:01:08,705 --> 00:01:10,340
You can read more about that in a book called

28
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:13,510
Doing Cultural Studies by Hugh Mackay and Linda Janes.
