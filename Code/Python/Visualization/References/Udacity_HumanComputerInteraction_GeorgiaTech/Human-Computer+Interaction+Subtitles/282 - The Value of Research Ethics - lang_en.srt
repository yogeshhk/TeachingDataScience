00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:03,350
In this lesson, we're largely
focusing on the practical steps we

2
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:06,285
go through to get approval for
human subject's research.

3
00:00:06,285 --> 00:00:09,480
But before we get into that, I want to
highlight that this isn't just a bunch

4
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:12,130
of bureaucratic steps necessary to
make sure the people are treated

5
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:16,010
ethically at all stages of research,
IRBs main task is to make sure

6
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:19,610
the potential benefits of the study
are worth the potential risks.

7
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:20,840
So as part of that,

8
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:24,470
part of the role is to make sure
the potential benefits are significant.

9
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:27,060
A lot of the steps of the process are
going to ensure that the data that we

10
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:28,430
gather is useful.

11
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:32,780
So for example, the IRB is sensitive
about the perception of coercion.

12
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:35,840
When participants feel coerced
to participate in research,

13
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,270
the data they actually supply may be
skewed by that negative perception

14
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:41,440
which impacts our results.

15
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:44,480
Similarly, we might design studies
that have some inherent biases or

16
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:45,560
issues to them.

17
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:47,220
We might demand too much
from participants or

18
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:49,970
ask questions that are known
to affect our results.

19
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:52,470
Much of the initial training to be
certified to perform research is

20
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:55,500
similarly not just about
doing ethical research but

21
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,850
also about doing good research.

22
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:01,400
By recording who is certified,
IRB helps ensure that research personnel

23
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:04,569
all understand the basics
of human subjects research.

24
00:01:04,569 --> 00:01:07,990
IRB is also there to monitor for these
things as well and many of the steps of

25
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:11,900
this process ensure that the research
we perform is sound and useful.

26
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:14,820
After all, if the research
we perform is not useful,

27
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:18,220
then even the smallest risks will
outweigh the nonexistent benefits.
