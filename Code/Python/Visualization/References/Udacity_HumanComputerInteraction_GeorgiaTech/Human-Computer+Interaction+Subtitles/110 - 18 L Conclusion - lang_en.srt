00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,830
Today, we've talked about

2
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:07,424
two applications of effective feedback cycles:

3
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:10,230
direct manipulation and invisible interfaces.

4
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:13,110
We talked about how interfaces are most effective when the user has

5
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:16,410
a sense that they're directly manipulating the object and their tasks.

6
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:19,200
We talked about how modern technology like touchscreens and

7
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:23,175
virtual reality are making it possible for manipulation to feel more and more direct.

8
00:00:23,175 --> 00:00:25,440
We talked about how the most effective interfaces

9
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:27,900
become invisible between the user and their task.

10
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:31,545
Since the user it spends no time at all thinking about the interface.

11
00:00:31,545 --> 00:00:34,905
We talked about interfaces can become invisible via either learning,

12
00:00:34,905 --> 00:00:38,770
or design and are most interested in designing them to become invisible.

13
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:42,300
To a large extent, that's the definition of usable design,

14
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:46,590
designing interfaces that disappear between the user and their task.
