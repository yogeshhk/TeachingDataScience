1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:02,640
So our user has received some input.

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:05,870
It's entered her memory,
she cognitively processed it.

3
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:08,910
Now it's time to act in
the world in response.

4
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:09,990
In designing interfaces,

5
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:13,910
we're also interested in what is
physically possible for users to do.

6
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:14,810
This includes things like,

7
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:18,890
how fast they can move, or how precisely
they can click or tap on something.

8
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:22,400
For example, here are two versions of
the Spotify control widget that appears

9
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,190
on Android phones.

10
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:26,910
On the left is the version that's
available in the tray of the phone that

11
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:30,430
you can access at any given time by
swiping down on the phone screen.

12
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:33,240
And on the right is the version that
appears on the lock screen when you turn

13
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:35,770
on a locked phone while
it's playing music.

14
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:39,110
In each case, the X closes the app,

15
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:41,710
which is consistent with
a lot of other applications.

16
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:42,310
The forward,

17
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:46,210
back and pause buttons are similarly
consistent with their usual meanings.

18
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:47,940
I don't actually know what
the plus sign here does.

19
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:50,940
It's doesn't have a clear mapping
to some underlying function.

20
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:55,430
Now note on the left, we have the close
button, in the top right corner.

21
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:57,980
It's far away from anything
else in the widget.

22
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:01,010
On the right, the close button
is right beside the skip button.

23
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:03,270
I can speak from considerable
personal experience, and

24
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:07,320
say that the level of specificity or
the level of precision required to tap

25
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:11,880
that X, instead of tapping the skip
button, is pretty significant.

26
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:14,840
Especially if you're using this
while running or driving, or

27
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:18,500
anything besides just sitting there,
interacting directly with your phone.

28
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:21,250
The precision of the user's
ability to tap on a button is

29
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:24,050
significantly reduced
in those situations.

30
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:27,900
And in this case, that can lead to the
quick error of closing the application

31
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:30,930
when all you're trying to do is
skip forward to the next song.

32
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:32,940
This isn't an error in
the perception of the screen.

33
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:34,750
It's not an error in their
memory of the controls.

34
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:38,210
They're not thinking that the X
button actually is the skip button.

35
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:40,780
This is just an error in what they're
physically able to perform at

36
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:41,910
a given time.

37
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:45,140
The interface relies on more precision
than they would have in many

38
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:46,800
circumstances.

39
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:50,420
So this design doesn't take into
consideration the motor system

40
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:54,920
of the user or the full context
surrounding usage of this application.

41
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:57,290
This isn't as significant
in the design on the left,

42
00:01:57,290 --> 00:01:59,990
because there's more room
around that close button.

43
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:01,290
If I aim for the forward button and

44
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:04,110
miss, the worst that's going to
happen is I might pause it.

45
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:05,840
I'm not going to close it by accident.

46
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,533
This is one example of how we need to be
aware of the constraints on the user's

47
00:02:09,533 --> 00:02:10,169
motor system.

48
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:14,110
What they can physically do, how precise
or accurate they can be, and so on.

49
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:16,925
And we have to be aware of that in
the context where the application is

50
00:02:16,925 --> 00:02:18,510
going to be used as well.

51
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:21,820
These buttons are no smaller than
the keys on a smart phone keyboard but

52
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:24,940
we expect more specificity when they're
sitting there typing with their thumbs,

53
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:26,050
as opposed to reaching over and

54
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:28,630
interacting real quick on
something on the lock screen.

55
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:31,150
Now of course, there might be
other constraints around this.

56
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:33,890
There might be a reason why
this button's placed there.

57
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:36,768
There might be some constraint in the
Android system that doesn't let them use

58
00:02:36,768 --> 00:02:38,780
more than one row of the lock screen.

59
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:42,510
In that case, we would need to make
our interface more tolerant of errors.

60
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:45,250
Maybe require a double
tap to close the app, or

61
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:47,920
maybe we mute it when it's pressed and
then gives the user five seconds to

62
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,940
confirm that that's actually
what they want to do.

63
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:52,600
Those are ways of reducing
the penalty for errors.
