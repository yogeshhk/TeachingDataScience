[MUSIC].

2
00:00:05,991 --> 00:00:09,500
When we've developed a good
understanding of the needs of our user,

3
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:12,828
it's time to move on to the second
phase of the design life cycle,

4
00:00:12,828 --> 00:00:14,052
design alternatives.

5
00:00:14,052 --> 00:00:16,748
This is when we start to brainstorm
how to accomplish the task we've been

6
00:00:16,748 --> 00:00:18,160
investigating.

7
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:23,050
The problem here is that design is very
hard, it's hard for a number of reasons.

8
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:24,720
The number of choices we have to make,
and

9
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,190
things we have to control is
more expansive than ever before.

10
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:32,390
Are we designing for desktops,
laptops, tablets, smart phones,

11
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:35,160
smart watches, augmented reality,
virtual reality, 2D, 3D,

12
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:39,990
gesture input, pen input, keyboard
input, mouse input, voice input?

13
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:43,940
In this lesson, we're going to talk
about how to generate ideas for designs.

14
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:46,720
And then we'll chat about how to
explore those ideas a bit further

15
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:48,530
to figure out what you
want to actually pursue.
