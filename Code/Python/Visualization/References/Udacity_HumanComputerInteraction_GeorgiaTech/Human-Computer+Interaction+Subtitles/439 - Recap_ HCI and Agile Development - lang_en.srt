00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,485
Traditional HCI can be a slow deliberate process but by

2
00:00:04,485 --> 00:00:09,120
constant interaction with users as we slowly ramp up the fidelity of our prototypes.

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:13,545
In the past, that was because every phase of the process was very expensive,

4
00:00:13,545 --> 00:00:15,360
from development to distribution,

5
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,145
to evaluation, to updating.

6
00:00:17,145 --> 00:00:22,200
But now, in some contexts those steps have become much much cheaper.

7
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:26,000
Some web development can be done by simple drag and drop interfaces.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,510
We can now distribute applications to millions of users essentially for free.

9
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:33,480
We can then pull back enormous quantities of live data from

10
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:36,955
them and push updates to all of them in a real time.

11
00:00:36,955 --> 00:00:40,040
Given all that, sometimes it might be more prudent to

12
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:43,925
particularly working the versions quickly to start getting real user data faster.

13
00:00:43,925 --> 00:00:46,550
So, we also discussed agile methods

14
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:49,340
for development while keeping an eye on the design life cycle.

15
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:51,800
These methods aren't appropriate for all areas,

16
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:54,470
especially those with high cost of failure but for

17
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:58,910
many places they can really increase the iteration speed of our design lifecycle.
