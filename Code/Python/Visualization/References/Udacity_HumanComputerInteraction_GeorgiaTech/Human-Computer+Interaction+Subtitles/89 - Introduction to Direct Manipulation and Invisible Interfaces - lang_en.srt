Today we'll talk about two
applications of good feedback cycles.

3
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:12,540
Direct manipulation and
invisible interfaces.

4
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:15,410
Direct manipulation is the principle
that the user should feel as much as

5
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:19,190
possible like they're directly
controlling the object of their task.

6
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:21,890
So for example, if you're trying
to enlarge an image on your phone,

7
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:24,670
it might be better to be able
to drag it with your fingers

8
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:26,820
rather than tapping a button that says,
zoom in.

9
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:29,990
That way you're really interacting
directly with the photo.

10
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:32,090
New technologies like touch
screens are making it more and

11
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:34,420
more possible to feel like we're
directly manipulating something,

12
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:36,680
even when there's
an interface in the way.

13
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:39,180
At their best,
the interface actually disappears,

14
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:41,690
which is what we mean by
an invisible interface.

15
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:44,620
With an invisible interface
the user has to spend no time

16
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:46,750
thinking about the interface
that they're using.

17
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:50,150
All their time is dedicated to thinking
about the task that they're performing.
