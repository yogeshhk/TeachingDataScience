00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:01,830
In discussing human abilities,

2
00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:05,960
we're going to adopt something similar
to the processor view of the human.

3
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:08,010
For now we're interested
in what they can do,

4
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:11,010
physically, cognitively, and so on.

5
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:14,330
So we're going to focus exclusively
on what's going on over here.

6
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:16,570
We're going to look at how
the person makes sense of input, and

7
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:18,310
how they then act in the world.

8
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:20,890
And right now, we're not going to worry
too much about where that input came

9
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:23,950
from, or what their actions
in the world actually do.

10
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:26,860
Notice that in this lesson we're
discussing the human, almost the same

11
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:30,530
way we discuss the computer, or
the interface, in most lessons.

12
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:32,280
The human is something
that produces output and

13
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:35,690
consumes input,
just like a computer might be otherwise.

14
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:38,450
But for now, we're only interested
in how the human does this.
