1
00:00:00,498 --> 00:00:03,330
User centered design is about
integrating the user into

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:05,490
every phase of the design life cycle.

3
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:07,240
So, we need to know two things.

4
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:12,280
What the design life cycle is and how
to integrate the user into each phase.

5
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:16,770
Now if you look up design life cycles
you'll find a lot of different ideas.

6
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:20,660
We're going to discuss in terms of
a four phase design life cycle that's

7
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:24,110
pretty general and probably subsumes
many of the other ones you'll find.

8
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:26,425
The first part of this is Needfinding.

9
00:00:26,425 --> 00:00:29,855
In Needfinding, we gather a
comprehensive understanding of the task

10
00:00:29,855 --> 00:00:31,765
the users are trying to perform.

11
00:00:31,765 --> 00:00:33,205
That includes who the user is,

12
00:00:33,205 --> 00:00:36,145
what the context of the task is,
why they're doing the task, and

13
00:00:36,145 --> 00:00:39,437
any other information related
to what we're designing.

14
00:00:39,437 --> 00:00:42,577
Second, we develop multiple
design alternatives.

15
00:00:42,577 --> 00:00:47,047
These are very early ideas on
the different ways to approach the task.

16
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:50,187
It's important to develop multiple
alternatives to avoid getting stuck in

17
00:00:50,187 --> 00:00:51,960
one idea too soon.

18
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,920
The third step is prototyping.

19
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,870
We take the ideas with the most
potential and we build them into

20
00:00:56,870 --> 00:01:00,510
prototypes that we can then
actually put in front of a user.

21
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:03,640
Early on we might do this in very low
fidelity ways like with a paper and

22
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:06,460
pencil, or
even just verbally describing our ideas.

23
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:09,470
But as we go on we refine and improve.

24
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:12,930
Fourth, and most importantly,
we perform user evaluation.

25
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:17,390
We take our ideas that we prototyped and
put them in front of actual users.

26
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:20,110
We get their feedback, what they like
and what they don't like, what works and

27
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:23,120
what doesn't work, and
then the cycle begins anew.

28
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,830
The feedback we gain from the users,

29
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:26,990
as well as our experience
with these prototypes and

30
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:30,850
design alternatives, improves our
understanding of the problem.

31
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:33,780
We now know new areas of the problem
we might need to explore with some more

32
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:35,270
need finding.

33
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:37,920
Now we might have some new ideas for
design alternatives, or

34
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,970
some new ways of expanding
the designs that we already have.

35
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:43,860
We then take those things and
use them to improve our prototypes.

36
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:47,120
Either prototyping new ideas
that we didn't have before, or

37
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:49,630
making our prototypes more rigorous and
more polished,

38
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:52,060
so that we can get
even better evaluation.

39
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:54,540
And then we put them in
front of users again.

40
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:57,490
Each time we go through this
cycle our understanding improves,

41
00:01:57,490 --> 00:02:00,100
our designs improve, and
our prototypes improve.

42
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:03,630
Eventually our prototypes develop to
the point of being designs ready for

43
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:06,070
launch, but the cycle doesn't end there.

44
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:09,479
We keep iterating, now with live
users doing the evaluation.
