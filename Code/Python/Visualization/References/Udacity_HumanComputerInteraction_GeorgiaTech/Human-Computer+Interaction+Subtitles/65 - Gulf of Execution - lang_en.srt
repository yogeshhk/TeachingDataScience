1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:04,400
In our feedback cycle diagram, we have
on the left, some user and on the right,

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:06,360
some task or system.

3
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:10,540
The user puts some input into
the system through the interface and

4
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:15,100
the system communicates some output back
to the user again through the interface.

5
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:19,150
Incumbent on this are two
general challenges,

6
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:22,350
the user's interaction with
the task through the interface and

7
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:25,720
the task's return to the user
of the output via the interface.

8
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:29,040
The first is called
the Gulf of execution.

9
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:33,680
The Gulf of execution can be defined
as how do I know what I can do.

10
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:36,600
The user has some goals.

11
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:39,260
How do they figure out how to
make those goals a reality?

12
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:43,290
How do they figure out
what actions to take

13
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:45,650
to make the state of the system
match their goal state?

14
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:48,850
This is the Gulf of execution.

15
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:52,130
How hard is it to do in
the interface what is necessary

16
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:53,665
to accomplish the users' goals?

17
00:00:53,665 --> 00:00:57,180
Or alternatively, what's
the difference between what the user

18
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:00,310
thinks they should have to do and
what they actually have to do.

19
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:03,750
Now there are a number
of components of this.

20
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:07,890
The first component, they need to be
able to identify what their goal is

21
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:10,140
in the context of the system.

22
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:12,640
There might be a mismatch between
their own understanding and

23
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,210
the system's structure.

24
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:18,030
Think of transitioning from an
old-fashioned VCR to a more modern DVR

25
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:21,100
or from a DVR to watching
things on-demand.

26
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:24,240
The user needs to think of their goal
in terms of their current system.

27
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:28,810
Second, they need to be able to
identify the actions necessary

28
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:30,780
to accomplish their goals.

29
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:34,390
Now that they know what their goal is in
the context of the system, they need to

30
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:37,600
identify the actions that it will
take to make that goal a reality.

31
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:41,230
And third,
once I've identified those actions,

32
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:43,830
they need to actually execute
the actions within the interface.

33
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:49,280
Again, imagine someone who's learning
to use an on demand video interface,

34
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,500
when they're used to using
things like VCRs and DVRs.

35
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,010
Their goal hasn't changed.

36
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:57,050
They want to watch some
program that's already aired.

37
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:58,690
But in the context of a VCR or

38
00:01:58,690 --> 00:02:02,180
a DVR, their intention might
be to record that program.

39
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,920
In the context of an on
demand video interface,

40
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:10,100
their intentions instead are to call up
the existing version of that program.

41
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:14,250
That's a mismatch between what
they think their goal is and

42
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:16,580
what their goal is in
the context of this new system.

43
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:20,690
But once they understand what the goal
means in their current system,

44
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:22,450
they now need to know how
to pull up that program.

45
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:25,390
They need to know how to
navigate the menus and

46
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:28,740
find the program that they want to
watch and then start it playing.

47
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:30,270
And then once they know what to do,

48
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:33,010
they need to actually execute
that series of button presses.

49
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:36,550
For example, they might know
what actions to perform but

50
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:38,950
they might not know where to find them.

51
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:42,330
That would present a difficulty
in executing those actions.

52
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:45,990
So the gulf of execution takes the user
from understanding their own goals

53
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:48,060
to understanding their goals
in the context of the system,

54
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:52,070
to understanding the actions
necessary to realize those goals,

55
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:54,430
to actually executing those actions.

56
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:56,630
And each of these presents
some difficulties.
