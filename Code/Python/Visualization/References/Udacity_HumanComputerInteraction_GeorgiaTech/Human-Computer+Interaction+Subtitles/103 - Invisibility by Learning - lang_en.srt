1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,340
We shouldn't fall into the trap of
assuming that just because an interface

2
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:06,140
has become invisible,
the design is great.

3
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:08,980
Interfaces become invisible not
just through great design, but

4
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:11,290
also because users learn to use them.

5
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:12,610
With enough practice and experience,

6
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:15,790
many users will become sufficiently
comfortable with many interfaces

7
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:17,910
to feel invisibly
integrated in the task.

8
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:19,960
So take driving for example.

9
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:23,450
Lets say I'm driving a car and
I discover I'm headed right for someone.

10
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:24,720
What's my reaction?

11
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,090
Well I turn the wheel to the side and
I press my brake.

12
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:28,690
It's instinctive.

13
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:32,290
I do it immediately, but
think about that action.

14
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:33,580
If I was just running
down the street and

15
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:35,530
suddenly I saw someone in front
of me would it be natural for

16
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:36,320
me to go like that?

17
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,110
Of course not.

18
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:41,140
The steering wheel was an interface
I used to turn to the left.

19
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:44,030
But it's become invisible during
the task of driving because of all my

20
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:45,360
practice with it.

21
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,150
But just because the interface has
become invisible doesn't mean it's great

22
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:49,210
interface.

23
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:50,665
People spend months learning to drive,

24
00:00:50,665 --> 00:00:52,212
they pay hundreds of dollars for
classes.

25
00:00:52,212 --> 00:00:53,750
And they have to pass
a complicated test.

26
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:57,160
Driving is important enough that it
can have that kind of learning curve.

27
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:00,040
But for the interfaces that we design,
we generally can't expect users to

28
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:02,650
give us an entire year
just to learn to use them.

29
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:05,480
We'll be lucky if they give us
an entire minute to learn to use them.

30
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:08,820
So our goal is to make our
interfaces invisible by design.
