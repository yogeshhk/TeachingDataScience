1
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:03,770
For me, we have a system at
Udacity we use to record hours for

2
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:06,410
those of us that work on
some contract projects.

3
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:09,400
It asks us to enter the number of hours
of the day we spend on each of a number

4
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,160
of different types of work.

5
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:12,440
The problem is that,

6
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:15,680
that assumes something closely
resembling the processor model.

7
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:18,870
A computer can easily track how
long different processes take.

8
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:22,250
But for me, checking the amount of
time spent on different tasks can be

9
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:23,308
basically impossible.

10
00:00:23,308 --> 00:00:27,460
Checking my e-mails involves switching
between five different tasks a minute.

11
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:28,590
How am I suppose to track that?

12
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:32,015
The system doesn't take into
consideration a realistic view

13
00:00:32,015 --> 00:00:33,975
of my role in the system.

14
00:00:33,975 --> 00:00:36,765
Something more similar to
the predictor view would be, well,

15
00:00:36,765 --> 00:00:38,515
the classroom you're viewing this in.

16
00:00:38,515 --> 00:00:41,865
Surrounding this video are a visual
organization of the lesson's content,

17
00:00:41,865 --> 00:00:44,005
a meter measuring your
progress through the video,

18
00:00:44,005 --> 00:00:46,265
representations of
the video's transcript.

19
00:00:46,265 --> 00:00:49,025
These are all meant to equip you with
the knowledge to predict what's coming

20
00:00:49,025 --> 00:00:50,010
next.

21
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:52,710
This classroom takes
a predictor view of the user.

22
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:55,480
It offloads some of the cognitive
load onto the interface

23
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:57,110
allowing you to focus on the material.

24
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,720
For the third view I personally would
consider my alarm clock an example.

25
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,980
I use an alarm clock app called Sleep.

26
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:07,030
It monitors my sleep cycles,
rings at the optimal time and

27
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:09,580
tracks my sleep patterns
to make recommendations.

28
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:14,050
It understand its role as part of a
broader system needed to help me sleep.

29
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:17,000
It goes far beyond just interaction
between me and an interface.

30
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,150
It integrates into the entire system.
