1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,085
Let's pretend this is a reaction time study because that gives us some nice numeric data.

2
00:00:04,085 --> 00:00:06,510
We're curious, what color should be used to alert

3
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:09,480
a driver in a car that they're starting to leave their lane?

4
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:11,010
We run half of them with orange,

5
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:14,295
and half of them with green in a between subjects design.

6
00:00:14,295 --> 00:00:16,440
As a result, they've generated some data.

7
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,755
These are each participant's reaction times.

8
00:00:18,755 --> 00:00:22,290
Our goal is to compare this data and decide which is better.

9
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:25,050
So, how do we do that? Well, we might just average it.

10
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:27,550
So, it looks like the orange is smaller than the green, right?

11
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:31,035
So, the orange is better, and not so fast, no pun intended.

12
00:00:31,035 --> 00:00:33,165
These numbers are very close.

13
00:00:33,165 --> 00:00:37,195
It's entirely possible this difference arose just by random chance.

14
00:00:37,195 --> 00:00:39,840
They're not likely going to be exactly equal in any trial.

15
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,160
The question is are they different enough to conclude that they're really different?

16
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,150
In fact, in this case, they definitely are if you run the numbers.

17
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:51,260
The process for actually doing this rigorously is called hypothesis testing.

18
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:52,880
Whenever we're trying to prove something,

19
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:55,615
we initially hypothesized that the opposite is true.

20
00:00:55,615 --> 00:00:58,460
So, if we're trying to prove that one of these options is better than the other,

21
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:01,835
we initially hypothesized that actually, they are equal.

22
00:01:01,835 --> 00:01:03,650
That's the null hypothesis.

23
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:06,140
It's the hypothesis that we accept if we can't find

24
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:09,145
sufficient data to support the alternative hypothesis.

25
00:01:09,145 --> 00:01:12,050
So, we want to see if this difference is big enough to

26
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:15,590
accept the alternative hypothesis instead of the null hypothesis.

27
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:18,980
We generally accept the alternative hypothesis if there's less than

28
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:23,200
a five percent chance that the difference could have arisen by random chance.

29
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,720
In that case, we say that the difference is statistically significant.

30
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,580
So, here, there's probably

31
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:31,595
a pretty good chance that this difference could arise by random chance,

32
00:01:31,595 --> 00:01:34,050
not because orange is actually any better than green.

33
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:36,124
But imagine if the data changed.

34
00:01:36,124 --> 00:01:39,950
Imagine if these were our observations from green instead of the ones before.

35
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:43,670
Our average has gone up considerably from 0.3 to 0.44.

36
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:46,790
Here, it's unlikely for this difference to

37
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:49,830
be based only on random chance. It's still possible.

38
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:51,445
It's just far less likely.

39
00:01:51,445 --> 00:01:54,065
This is the general process of hypothesis testing.

40
00:01:54,065 --> 00:01:56,240
Assuming that things are the same and seeing if

41
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,860
the data is sufficient to prove that they're different.
