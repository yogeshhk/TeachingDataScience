00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,888
The Mac Touchpad has some interesting
examples of how you can make indirect

2
00:00:03,888 --> 00:00:05,623
manipulation feel more direct.

3
00:00:05,623 --> 00:00:09,205
For example, if I swipe from the right
to the left on the touchpad with two

4
00:00:09,205 --> 00:00:12,519
fingers, it pulls up this notification
center over on the right.

5
00:00:12,519 --> 00:00:15,452
This feels direct because
the notification center popped up in

6
00:00:15,452 --> 00:00:18,173
the same place on the screen
that I swiped on the touchpad.

7
00:00:18,173 --> 00:00:21,290
The touchpad is almost like
a miniature version of the screen.

8
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:24,270
But they could have placed
a notification center anywhere and

9
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:26,300
used any kind of
interaction to pull it up.

10
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:29,110
This isn't like scrolling where there is
something fundamental about the content

11
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:30,530
that demands a certain
kind of interaction.

12
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:32,930
They could have designed
this however they wanted.

13
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:35,030
But by placing the notification
center there and

14
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:38,700
using that interaction to pull it up,
it feels more direct.

15
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:40,863
Now, animation can also
help us accomplish this.

16
00:00:40,863 --> 00:00:45,247
On the Touchpad, I can clear the windows
off my desktop by kind of spreading out

17
00:00:45,247 --> 00:00:47,041
my fingers on the touchpad, and

18
00:00:47,041 --> 00:00:50,290
the animation shows them
going off to the side.

19
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:52,765
And while that's kind of
like clearing off your desk,

20
00:00:52,765 --> 00:00:56,535
I'd argue it's not close enough to feel
direct except that the animation on

21
00:00:56,535 --> 00:00:59,225
screen mimics that action as well.

22
00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:00,265
The windows could have faded away or

23
00:01:00,265 --> 00:01:01,555
they could have just
slid to the bottom and

24
00:01:01,555 --> 00:01:04,855
still accomplish the same function
of hiding what's on my desktop.

25
00:01:04,855 --> 00:01:07,945
But the animation they chose
reinforces that interaction.

26
00:01:07,945 --> 00:01:09,165
It makes it feel more direct.

27
00:01:09,165 --> 00:01:12,125
The same thing actually applies with
Launchpad, which we bring up with

28
00:01:12,125 --> 00:01:15,200
the opposite function by
pinching our fingers together.

29
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,330
The animation looks kind of like
we're pulling back a little bit or

30
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:21,270
zooming out and
we see the launch pad come into view,

31
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:24,600
just as the gesture is similar
to zooming out on the screen.

32
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:27,700
So direct manipulation isn't just
about designing interactions that

33
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:30,090
feel like you're directly
manipulating the interface.

34
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:33,380
It's also about designing
interfaces that lend themselves to

35
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:35,120
interactions that feel more direct.
