1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:01,378
Generally speaking,

2
00:00:01,378 --> 00:00:04,252
you might not ever be asked to
complete a protocol yourself.

3
00:00:04,252 --> 00:00:07,410
You might instead just be
added to an existing protocol.

4
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:10,378
Still, you need to make sure to
understand the procedures outlined by

5
00:00:10,378 --> 00:00:13,668
any protocol to which you're added,
because they still govern what you do.

6
00:00:13,668 --> 00:00:17,464
So we'll run through the process of
creating a protocol, but this will also

7
00:00:17,464 --> 00:00:20,870
cover the details to know about any
protocol to which you are added.

8
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:21,735
So for this,

9
00:00:21,735 --> 00:00:26,475
I have a draft protocol covering our
user study on people who exercise.

10
00:00:26,475 --> 00:00:29,325
Every protocol starts with
the title of the protocol, and

11
00:00:29,325 --> 00:00:30,730
some certified personnel.

12
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:33,345
These are required just
to save the protocol.

13
00:00:33,345 --> 00:00:37,146
We add approved research personnel
on the study personnel page.

14
00:00:37,146 --> 00:00:40,353
We would enter their name,
select their role, and

15
00:00:40,353 --> 00:00:45,364
if their certification isn't already
in the system, we would attach it here.

16
00:00:45,364 --> 00:00:47,690
After adding them,
they'll appear down here.

17
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:51,598
The primary investigator, PI,
must always be added first and

18
00:00:51,598 --> 00:00:53,376
it must be a faculty member.

19
00:00:53,376 --> 00:00:57,205
The protocol description covers
the study at a high level.

20
00:00:57,205 --> 00:00:59,732
This should briefly touch
on what will be done,

21
00:00:59,732 --> 00:01:03,404
what the goal of the research is and
what subjects will be asked to do.

22
00:01:03,404 --> 00:01:05,937
It doesn't cover all the details,
but it covers enough for

23
00:01:05,937 --> 00:01:09,039
someone to understand generally what
we're going for with this study.

24
00:01:09,039 --> 00:01:12,054
Under the research design and
methodology section,

25
00:01:12,054 --> 00:01:13,599
we describe our research.

26
00:01:13,599 --> 00:01:16,290
First, we describe the research
design in the methodology.

27
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:18,051
With human subjects research,

28
00:01:18,051 --> 00:01:21,453
this focuses on what users will
experience and in what order.

29
00:01:21,453 --> 00:01:24,886
It also covers some experimental details
like how subjects might be assigned

30
00:01:24,886 --> 00:01:26,643
different experimental conditions.

31
00:01:26,643 --> 00:01:30,901
Then we describe the duration of subject
participation to make sure subjects

32
00:01:30,901 --> 00:01:32,873
aren't being asked to do too much.

33
00:01:32,873 --> 00:01:37,245
Depending on what we're doing, we may
need to provide data collection methods.

34
00:01:37,245 --> 00:01:41,340
This includes things like surveys,
pre-tests and post-tests interview

35
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:45,306
scripts, anything pre-prepared to
elicit data for the participant.

36
00:01:45,306 --> 00:01:48,045
Then we also need to fully describe
the potential benefits of the study.

37
00:01:48,045 --> 00:01:51,625
Remember, IRB is about making sure
that the benefits out way the risks.

38
00:01:51,625 --> 00:01:55,310
If there are no benefits, then
the benefits can't out way the risks.

39
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:58,423
Benefits don't need to be to
the individual participants though,

40
00:01:58,423 --> 00:02:00,887
but they could be to the greater
community as a whole.

41
00:02:00,887 --> 00:02:04,903
Similarly, we also needed to describe
the risks associated with the study.

42
00:02:04,903 --> 00:02:06,104
For usability studies,

43
00:02:06,104 --> 00:02:08,800
very often our risks are not
going to be very significant.

44
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,439
Our risks might be those associated
with normal work at a computer.

45
00:02:12,439 --> 00:02:15,354
But we still need to address this to
acknowledge that we thought about what

46
00:02:15,354 --> 00:02:17,740
risks might arise to participants.

47
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:21,248
Then we describe the plan for
the statistical analysis if we have one.

48
00:02:21,248 --> 00:02:23,930
Qualitative research might not have
a statistical analysis plan, so

49
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:25,890
that's why I've left this blank.

50
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:29,191
Finally, we need to describe start and
end dates of the research.

51
00:02:29,191 --> 00:02:32,373
Very often, this will break the research
into a data collection phase and

52
00:02:32,373 --> 00:02:35,567
a research phase, where we actually
analyze the data that we collected.

53
00:02:35,567 --> 00:02:38,780
Now we won't generally need to worry
about many of the remaining options on

54
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:41,279
this form, because we're not
doing clinical studies and

55
00:02:41,279 --> 00:02:44,900
we generally don't have external funding
unless you're working on a professor's

56
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:45,782
research project.

57
00:02:45,782 --> 00:02:48,010
So now let's move on to subject details.
