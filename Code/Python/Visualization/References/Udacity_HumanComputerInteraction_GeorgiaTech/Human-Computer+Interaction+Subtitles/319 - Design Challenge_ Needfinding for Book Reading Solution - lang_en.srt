1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,360
We could apply pretty much every single
need-finding method that we've discussed

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:04,720
to this task.

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:07,950
We could, for example, go to the library
and just watch people reading and

4
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:09,850
see how they're taking notes.

5
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:11,360
We've all likely done it ourselves.

6
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:14,690
We can reflect on what we do
while reading, although again,

7
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:17,680
we need to be careful not to over-value
our own priorities and approaches.

8
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:21,490
Reading is common enough,
that we can easily find participants for

9
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:23,620
interviews, surveys, think alouds.

10
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:27,450
The challenge here will be
deciding who our users really are.

11
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:28,640
Books are ubiquitous.

12
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,860
Are we trying to cater to
everyone who reads deliberately?

13
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:36,200
If so, we need to sample a wide
range of users or initially,

14
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,740
we could choose a subset.

15
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:40,870
We might cater to students who
are studying or busy business people, or

16
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:43,580
people that specifically walk or
bike to work.

17
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:47,280
We might start with one of those groups
and then abstract out over time.

18
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,980
We might eventually abstract all the way
to just anyone who's unable to read and

19
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:53,670
take notes the traditional way
like people driving cars or

20
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:56,970
people with visual impairments but
that's further down the road.

21
00:00:56,970 --> 00:01:00,300
The more important thing is
that we define who our user is,

22
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:03,850
define the task in which we're
interested, and deliberately design for

23
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:07,270
that user and that task through
out the design life cycle.
