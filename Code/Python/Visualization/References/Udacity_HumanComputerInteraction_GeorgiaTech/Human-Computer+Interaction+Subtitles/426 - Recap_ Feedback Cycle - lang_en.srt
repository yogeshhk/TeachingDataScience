1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,435
We started the first unit by discussing feedback cycles.

2
00:00:03,435 --> 00:00:05,115
Feedback cycles, as we discussed,

3
00:00:05,115 --> 00:00:07,470
are ubiquitous in basically all areas of life.

4
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:09,899
They're how we learn and adapt to our environments,

5
00:00:09,899 --> 00:00:13,680
and they're also how we learn and adapt to the interfaces available to us.

6
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,830
We then described the two parts of feedback cycles.

7
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:21,840
Gulfs of execution covered how users go from personal goals to external actions,

8
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:25,109
and gulfs of evaluation covered how the users then evaluated

9
00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:29,115
whether or not the results of those actions met their original goals.

10
00:00:29,115 --> 00:00:33,780
We can describe a lot of HCI as designing ways to bridge these two gulfs,

11
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:36,360
helping users more easily accomplish their goals,

12
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:40,520
and helping users more quickly identify when their goals have been accomplished.
