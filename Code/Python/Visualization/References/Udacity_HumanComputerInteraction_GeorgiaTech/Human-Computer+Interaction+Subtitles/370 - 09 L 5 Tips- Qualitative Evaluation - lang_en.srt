00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:07,575
Here are five quick tips for conducting successful evaluations.

2
00:00:07,575 --> 00:00:10,510
Number one, run pilot studies.

3
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:12,570
Recruiting participants is hard.

4
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:15,405
You want to make sure that once you start working with real users,

5
00:00:15,405 --> 00:00:17,430
you're ready to gather really useful data.

6
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:21,285
So, try it your experiment with friends or family or co-workers

7
00:00:21,285 --> 00:00:23,715
before trying it out with real users to

8
00:00:23,715 --> 00:00:26,565
iron out the kinks in your design and your directions.

9
00:00:26,565 --> 00:00:29,595
Number two, focus on feedback.

10
00:00:29,595 --> 00:00:32,625
It's tempting in qualitative evaluations to spend

11
00:00:32,625 --> 00:00:35,570
too much time trying to teach this one user.

12
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:38,240
If the user criticizes an element of the prototype,

13
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:40,535
you don't need to explain to them the rationale.

14
00:00:40,535 --> 00:00:43,655
Your goal is to get feedback to design the next interface,

15
00:00:43,655 --> 00:00:46,130
not to just teach this one current user.

16
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:50,215
Number three, use questions when users get stuck.

17
00:00:50,215 --> 00:00:54,335
That way, you get some information on why they're stuck, and what they're thinking.

18
00:00:54,335 --> 00:00:57,020
Those questions can also be used to guide users to how they

19
00:00:57,020 --> 00:01:00,425
should use it to make the session seem less instructional.

20
00:01:00,425 --> 00:01:03,655
Number four, tell users what to do,

21
00:01:03,655 --> 00:01:05,250
but not how to do it.

22
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:07,015
This doesn't always apply,

23
00:01:07,015 --> 00:01:09,650
but most often we want to design interfaces that users

24
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:12,685
can use without any real instruction whatsoever.

25
00:01:12,685 --> 00:01:14,970
So, in performing qualitative evaluation,

26
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:17,415
give them instruction on what to accomplish,

27
00:01:17,415 --> 00:01:19,840
but let them try to figure out how to do it.

28
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,400
If they try to do it differently than what you expect,

29
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,240
then you know how to design the next interface.

30
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:28,935
Number five, capture satisfaction.

31
00:01:28,935 --> 00:01:32,030
Sometimes, we can get so distracted by whether or not users can use

32
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:35,840
our interface that we forget to ask them whether or not they like using our interface.

33
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:40,480
So, make sure to capture user satisfaction in your qualitative evaluation.
