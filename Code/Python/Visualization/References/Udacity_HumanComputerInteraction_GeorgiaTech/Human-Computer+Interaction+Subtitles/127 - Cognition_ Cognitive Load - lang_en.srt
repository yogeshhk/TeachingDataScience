1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:02,009
To talk about cognitive load,
let's think for

2
00:00:02,009 --> 00:00:04,470
a moment of the brain
like it's a computer.

3
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:06,460
The community is actually
divided on whether or

4
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:08,800
not the brain actually
operates this way, but for

5
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,570
the purposes of this explanation,
it's a useful metaphor.

6
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:14,505
So your brain has a certain number of
resources available to it, the same way

7
00:00:14,505 --> 00:00:17,795
your computer has a certain number of
processor resources available to it.

8
00:00:17,795 --> 00:00:21,455
Each thing that the brain is working
on takes up some of those resources.

9
00:00:21,455 --> 00:00:24,649
Let's say your at home in a quiet area,
working on a calculus problem that

10
00:00:24,649 --> 00:00:27,432
requires 60% of your
cognitive resources.

11
00:00:27,432 --> 00:00:31,032
In that setting, you have plenty of
resources to solve that problem.

12
00:00:31,032 --> 00:00:33,672
However, then you go to
take a calculus test.

13
00:00:33,672 --> 00:00:35,282
Now you have some stress in there.

14
00:00:35,282 --> 00:00:36,872
Now you're stressing
about the impact this

15
00:00:36,872 --> 00:00:38,252
test is going to have on your grade.

16
00:00:38,252 --> 00:00:40,860
You're stressing about how well
other people seem to think they

17
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:41,520
are doing on it.

18
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,240
Whether or not other people seem to
be struggling while you struggle.

19
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:46,730
This is taking up a lot of
your cognitive resources.

20
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:50,940
Here we see the stress taking up 50%
of the cognitive resources you have.

21
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:54,670
Now you don't have sufficient resources
to complete the problem successfully.

22
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:58,630
I hypothesize that's why test taking
anxiety can have such a negative effect.

23
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:02,020
It takes resources away from
actually working on the test.

24
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:05,099
You can apply these same principles
to the presence of distractions,

25
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:06,504
anxiety disorders and more.

26
00:01:06,504 --> 00:01:09,710
Cognitive load has two major
applications to our working design

27
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:10,950
interfaces.

28
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:14,610
One, we want to reduce the cognitive
load posed by the interface, so

29
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:17,120
that the user can focus on the task.

30
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:20,720
Second, we want to understand the
context of what else is going on while

31
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,378
users are using our interface.

32
00:01:22,378 --> 00:01:24,569
We need to understand what
else is competing for

33
00:01:24,569 --> 00:01:27,920
the cognitive resources users
need to use our interface.

34
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,440
If we're designing a GPS or
navigation system for

35
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:33,390
example, we want to be aware that
the user will have relatively

36
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:36,750
few cognitive resources because they're
focusing on so many things at once.
