00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:03,107
Lately I've encountered
another interesting example of

2
00:00:03,107 --> 00:00:04,345
feedback cycles in action.

3
00:00:04,345 --> 00:00:06,110
You may have actually
seen this before as well.

4
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:08,300
They're the new credit card readers.

5
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:10,310
My wife sells arts and
crafts at local events, and so

6
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:14,100
she has these Square readers that
can scan credit cards on her phone.

7
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:17,730
One version lets you swipe, and the new
version lets you insert the card.

8
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:19,200
So let's check this out real quick.

9
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,790
With the swipe version you just
insert the card and pull it through,

10
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:23,770
just like a traditional card reader.

11
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:26,640
The problem is there's typically no
feedback on whether you're swiping

12
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:27,640
correctly.

13
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:29,970
And what's more is you can
be wrong in both directions.

14
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:32,520
You can be both too fast or too slow.

15
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:35,360
So you may have had a time when you were
trying to swipe a credit card on some

16
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,370
kind of reader, and you kept doing it
more and more slowly and deliberately,

17
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:41,690
thinking that the problem was that
you had done it too fast originally.

18
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:44,560
And then you discover that you've
actually been going too slowly all along

19
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:47,160
and your slowing down was
actually counterproductive.

20
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:48,720
There's no feedback here and

21
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:51,450
the space and acceptable input
is bounded on both sides.

22
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:54,810
You have to go above one speed and
below another speed.

23
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:55,730
But now credit card readers

24
00:00:55,730 --> 00:00:58,019
are moving to this model where
you just insert the card.

25
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:00,920
You try, at least.

26
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:04,840
In terms of feedback cycles,
in what ways is this actually better?
