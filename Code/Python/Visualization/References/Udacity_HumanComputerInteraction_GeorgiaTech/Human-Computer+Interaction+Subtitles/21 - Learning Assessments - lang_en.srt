1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:03,540
Learning goals are what we
want you to understand.

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:06,330
Learning outcomes or
what we want you to be able to do.

3
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:09,950
Learning assessments then, are how we
evaluate whether you can do what we want

4
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:13,050
you to be able to do and understand
what we want you to understand.

5
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:16,059
The learning outcome to this
class is to be able to design

6
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:18,930
effective interactions
between humans and computers.

7
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:22,510
So the primary assessments in this
class are to, say it with me,

8
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:25,860
design effective interactions
between humans and computers.

9
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:29,590
You'll start with some relatively small
scale tasks, recommending improvements

10
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:33,165
to existing interfaces or or undertaking
some small design challenges.

11
00:00:33,165 --> 00:00:36,835
But as the semester goes on, you'll
scope up towards a bigger challenge.

12
00:00:36,835 --> 00:00:39,195
You'll initially investigate
that challenge individually and

13
00:00:39,195 --> 00:00:40,955
then you'll merge into
teams to prototype and

14
00:00:40,955 --> 00:00:44,025
evaluate a full solution
to the challenge you chose.

15
00:00:44,025 --> 00:00:48,225
At the end, you'll be evaluated not just
on the final design you generate but

16
00:00:48,225 --> 00:00:50,355
on the process by which
it was generated.
