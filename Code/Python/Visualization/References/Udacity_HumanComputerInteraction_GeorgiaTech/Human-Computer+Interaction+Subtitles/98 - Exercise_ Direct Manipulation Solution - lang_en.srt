1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:02,240
Now there's some room for
disagreement here, but

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:05,680
I think these five seem
to be pretty cut and dry.

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:06,640
We can think about whether or

4
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:09,410
not these are direct manipulation by
considering whether or not what we're

5
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:13,430
doing to the touchpad is what we'd
like to do to the screen itself.

6
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:16,900
For clicking, I would consider that
direct manipulation because just as we

7
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:19,740
press directly on the screen we're
pressing directly on a touchpad.

8
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:24,390
Right-clicking though,
the two finger tap, doesn't really

9
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:27,760
exemplify direct manipulation, because
there's nothing natural about using

10
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,700
two fingers to bring up a context menu
as opposed to using one to click.

11
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:33,270
We have to kind of learn that behavior.

12
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:36,070
Scrolling makes sense because with
scrolling it's like I'm physically

13
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:39,190
pulling the page up and
down to see different portions of it.

14
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:40,890
The two finger tap for zooming in and

15
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:43,890
out a little bit though isn't
really direct manipulation,

16
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:47,530
because there's no real clear reason
that needs to zoom in, zoom out.

17
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:50,690
Pinching on the other hand though,
makes sense.

18
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:52,930
Because it's as if I'm
physically grabbing the page and

19
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:55,000
shrinking and enlarging it.

20
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,230
So some of these I would say are pretty
good examples of direct manipulation.

21
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:00,380
While others are things that
we kind of have learn to do.
