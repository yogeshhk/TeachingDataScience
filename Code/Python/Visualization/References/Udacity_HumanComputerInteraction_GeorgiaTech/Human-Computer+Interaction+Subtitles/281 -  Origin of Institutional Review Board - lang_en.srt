00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:02,110
In the first half of the 20th century,

2
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:06,580
a number of pretty clearly unethical
human subjects experiments took place.

3
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:09,102
Many of them were conducted
by scientists working for

4
00:00:09,102 --> 00:00:10,846
the Axis powers during World War II.

5
00:00:10,846 --> 00:00:14,204
But famously, many were also conducted
right here in our own backyard,

6
00:00:14,204 --> 00:00:15,477
here in the United States.

7
00:00:15,477 --> 00:00:19,281
Among them were Milgam's obedience
experiment where participants were

8
00:00:19,281 --> 00:00:22,225
tricked into thinking that
they had administered lethal

9
00:00:22,225 --> 00:00:26,320
shocks to other participants to
see how obedient they would be.

10
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,172
There was the Tuskegee syphilis study
where rural African American men were

11
00:00:30,172 --> 00:00:34,084
intentionally injected with syphilis
to study its progression and there was

12
00:00:34,084 --> 00:00:38,239
the Stanford prison experiment where
participants were psychologically abused

13
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:42,291
to test their limits or test how they
would act under different circumstances.

14
00:00:42,291 --> 00:00:46,839
In response to all this, the National
Research Act of 1974 was passed,

15
00:00:46,839 --> 00:00:50,890
which led to the creation of
institutional review boards to oversee

16
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:52,610
research at universities.

17
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:56,781
The Belmont Report further summarizes
basic ethical principals that research

18
00:00:56,781 --> 00:01:00,420
must follow in order to
receive government support.

19
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:04,500
Among other things, the law dictated
that the benefits to society must

20
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:08,446
outweigh the risks to the subjects
in the case of these experiments.

21
00:01:08,446 --> 00:01:11,378
It also dictated that subjects
must be selected fairly,

22
00:01:11,378 --> 00:01:14,505
which was a direct response to
the Tuskegee syphilis study.

23
00:01:14,505 --> 00:01:16,152
And perhaps most importantly,

24
00:01:16,152 --> 00:01:19,250
it demanded a rigorous
informed consent procedures.

25
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:21,540
So, the participants know
what they're getting into and

26
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:23,740
can back out at any time.

27
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:27,355
These efforts all attempt to make sure
that the positive results of research

28
00:01:27,355 --> 00:01:32,040
outweigh the negatives and that
participant rights are always preserved.
