1
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:06,705
In this lesson, we talked about mental models.

2
00:00:06,705 --> 00:00:11,535
We discussed what mental models are and how the user uses them to make sense of a system.

3
00:00:11,535 --> 00:00:16,110
We discussed how good representations can help users achieve strong models.

4
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:18,750
We didn't discuss how issues with interfaces can lead to

5
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:22,500
two different kinds of user error slips and mistakes.

6
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,330
We then discuss learned helplessness,

7
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:27,360
which can come from giving poor feedback on user errors,

8
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,940
and finally, we discussed expert blind spot and

9
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:33,710
the importance of understanding that you are not your own user.
