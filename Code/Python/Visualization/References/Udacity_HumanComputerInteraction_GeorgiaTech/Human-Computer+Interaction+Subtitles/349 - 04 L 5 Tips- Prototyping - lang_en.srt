00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:06,750
Here are five quick tips for effective prototyping.

2
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:10,515
Number 1, keep prototypes easy to change.

3
00:00:10,515 --> 00:00:13,995
Your goal here is to enable rapid revision and improvement.

4
00:00:13,995 --> 00:00:16,860
It's easy to make quick changes to something on paper,

5
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:19,995
but it's harder to make it a code or physical prototypes.

6
00:00:19,995 --> 00:00:23,610
Number 2, make it clear that it's a prototype.

7
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:25,950
If you make a prototype look too good,

8
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:29,535
users may focus on superficial elements like colors or font.

9
00:00:29,535 --> 00:00:32,130
By letting your prototype look like a prototype,

10
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:35,190
you can help them focus on what you're ready to test.

11
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:37,770
Number 3, be creative.

12
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:39,780
Your goal is to get feedback.

13
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:42,160
Do whatever it takes to get feedback.

14
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,330
Don't let the type of prototype you're designing

15
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:46,550
constrain the kind of feedback you can get.

16
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:48,560
If you find your current prototypes don't give you

17
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:51,415
the right kind of feedback, find ones that do.

18
00:00:51,415 --> 00:00:54,680
Number 4, evaluate risks.

19
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:57,980
One of the biggest goals of prototyping is to minimize the time spent

20
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:01,475
pursuing bad designs by getting feedback on them early.

21
00:01:01,475 --> 00:01:04,190
How much would you lose if you found that users hate

22
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:06,650
the parts of your design that they haven't seen yet?

23
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:09,300
Whenever that answer gets to be longer than a couple hours,

24
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:12,620
try to get feedback to make sure you're not wasting time.

25
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:16,070
Number 5, prototype for feedback.

26
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:18,970
The goal of a prototype is to get feedback.

27
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:23,000
You could spend a lot of time focusing on details like font selection and color choice,

28
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,190
I know I do, but that's probably not the feedback

29
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:27,770
you need when you're exploring your big alternatives.

30
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:31,090
Prototype for the kind of feedback you want to get.
