1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:02,190
Before cars had push button starts,

2
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:05,050
this is where you inserted
the key to turn on the ignition.

3
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:05,913
Why?

4
00:00:05,913 --> 00:00:07,560
I have no idea.

5
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:08,910
But I do know that now,

6
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:11,810
the start button can be placed in
any number of different locations.

7
00:00:11,810 --> 00:00:14,270
So why do we put it where
we've always put it?

8
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:17,580
Well, the reason is, that's where
the driver expects it to be placed.

9
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:20,600
We help them across the gulf of
execution by designing a system that's

10
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:23,328
consistent with their expectations
about how it should work.

11
00:00:23,328 --> 00:00:27,350
It makes it easier for them to translate
their intentions into actions.

12
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:30,340
Now, other times we might violate this
principle because of some other benefits

13
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:31,390
we hope to gain.

14
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:33,420
But generally speaking,
when all else is equal,

15
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:36,490
we want to stay consistent with the way
users expect our systems to work.
