00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,280
Here's my answer to this
very complicated exercise.

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:06,880
Two methods that analyze
data that already exists

3
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:10,380
are Naturalistic Observation and
Errors and Hacks.

4
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:13,690
Naturalistic Observation doesn't
necessarily analyze data that

5
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:15,320
already exists, but

6
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:19,740
it analyzes data that's being produced
already on its own without observing it,

7
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:22,900
so we don't have to go out and create
an opportunity for data to happen.

8
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:26,800
We just have to observe it and capture
it where it's already taking place.

9
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,520
Errors and Hacks, look at the way users
already use interfaces to see what

10
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:33,680
errors they regularly make or when they
have to work around the interface.

11
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:38,340
The two methods that require no
recruitment are Naturalistic Observation

12
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:40,180
and Participant Observation.

13
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:43,120
In both cases, we don't need
other human participants to

14
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:47,050
come do anything differently based on
the fact that we're doing some research.

15
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:50,460
With interviews, surveys, Focus Groups,
apprenticeship and Think-Aloud, we're

16
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:53,930
always asking users to do something to
accommodate us or to give us some data.

17
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:58,270
And with Errors and Hacks, even if
we can view that data on our own,

18
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:01,080
we still need the user to give us
permission to view their workspace or

19
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:03,010
watch them do whatever they're doing.

20
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:05,521
There might be some times when
you can look for Errors and

21
00:01:05,521 --> 00:01:08,621
Hacks with Naturalistic Observation,
but generally you need to get

22
00:01:08,621 --> 00:01:11,722
enough into the users head to
understand why something's an error or

23
00:01:11,722 --> 00:01:13,336
why they need to use a certain hack.

24
00:01:13,336 --> 00:01:14,124
For the most part,

25
00:01:14,124 --> 00:01:16,790
all of these are going to need
some synchronous participation.

26
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:18,640
There might be some exceptions.

27
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,140
For example, we could do a retrospective
analysis of Errors and Hacks, or

28
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:24,950
we can have someone do a Think-Aloud
protocol where they actually write down

29
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:26,810
their thoughts after doing a task.

30
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:27,780
But generally speaking,

31
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:31,990
the way most of these are usually done,
they require synchronous participation.

32
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:33,510
Surveys are the exception.

33
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:35,050
Surveys we usually send out to someone,

34
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:37,220
wait some period of time,
and get back the results.

35
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:41,110
So we never have to be interacting
live with any of our participants.

36
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:41,970
That's one of the reasons why

37
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:44,760
surveys can get a lot more
data than other methods.

38
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:48,430
Adding more participants doesn't
necessarily require more of our time,

39
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:50,530
at least not to gather
the data in the first place.

40
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:52,672
Analyzing it might require
more time at the end, but

41
00:01:52,672 --> 00:01:54,091
that's not synchronous either.

42
00:01:54,091 --> 00:01:57,211
As far as investigating
participant thoughts is concerned,

43
00:01:57,211 --> 00:02:00,698
almost all these methods can
investigate this when used correctly.

44
00:02:00,698 --> 00:02:04,419
We could do a survey does not actually
investigate participants thoughts, but

45
00:02:04,419 --> 00:02:07,694
a well designed survey is going to
trying get a heart of the users thinks

46
00:02:07,694 --> 00:02:08,699
about things.

47
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:12,660
The only exception is Naturalistic
Observation where by definition,

48
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:15,400
we're just watching people we're
not interacting with them or

49
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,860
we're not asking them
what they are thinking.

50
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:21,230
It's always extremely valuable for us
to be able to do some needfinding that

51
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:23,880
occurs within the task context itself.

52
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,810
And unfortunately interviews and
surveys,

53
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:28,490
which are some of our most
common data gathering methods,

54
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:31,680
very often don't occur
within the task context.

55
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,960
Naturalistic Observation and Participant
Observation obviously do, but

56
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:38,160
since they don't involved getting
inside the real users head,

57
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,136
their contributions
are a little bit more limited.

58
00:02:40,136 --> 00:02:44,810
Apprenticeship and Think-Aloud really
capture the benefits of occurring within

59
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:48,260
the task context, because either
way we get the user's thoughts

60
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:51,410
while they're engaging with the task,
or immediately thereafter.

61
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:53,030
It is possible to do interviews and

62
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:57,730
Focus Groups within the task contexts
as well, it just isn't quite as common.

63
00:02:57,730 --> 00:03:00,750
Errors and Hacks are certainly debatable
as well, because the Errors and

64
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:04,950
Hacks themselves definitely occur
within the task context, but

65
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:07,400
our analysis of them usually doesn't.

66
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:10,990
And finally, as we talk about when
we discuss cognitive task analysis,

67
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:14,110
one of the challenges with needfinding
is that most of our approaches

68
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:16,440
are extremely expensive.

69
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,580
If we want to gather
a lot of data cheaply,

70
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:21,060
then we probably need
to rely on surveys.

71
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:24,320
Everything else is either going to
incur a pretty significant cost or

72
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:27,140
it just isn't capable of
gathering a lot of data.

73
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:29,840
For example, we could cheaply
be participant observations for

74
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:30,990
weeks on end, but

75
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:34,440
we're only ever going to gather data
from one person and that's never ideal.
