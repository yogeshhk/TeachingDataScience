1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:01,340
So what happened?

2
00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:04,059
Well, what likely happened is
that you maybe had only a little

3
00:00:04,059 --> 00:00:07,421
bit of trouble remembering the two real
words that were listed on the right.

4
00:00:07,421 --> 00:00:10,456
You might have had some more trouble
remembering the two words that were

5
00:00:10,456 --> 00:00:12,429
listed in the middle
that were fake words, but

6
00:00:12,429 --> 00:00:14,109
did nonetheless look like real words.

7
00:00:14,109 --> 00:00:16,847
And you probably had a lot of trouble
remembering the two series of letters

8
00:00:16,847 --> 00:00:18,220
over on the left.

9
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:19,650
Why is all of that?

10
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:22,060
Well, when it came to
memorizing these two words,

11
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:24,420
you were just calling up a chunk
that you've already had.

12
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:26,720
You didn't see these as arbitrary
collections of letters,

13
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,580
you just saw them as words.

14
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:31,400
For the ones in the middle, you've never
seen those combinations of letters

15
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:34,730
before, but you could pronounce
them as if they were words.

16
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:37,240
So you likely saw them as
fake words rather than just

17
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:38,910
random collection of letters.

18
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:43,170
For these over the left though, you had
to memorize five individual characters.

19
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:46,171
So that's means that while these four
were able to jump in the words or

20
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:47,190
pseudo words.

21
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:50,330
These likely had to be
remembered as five chunks each.

22
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:53,195
That's makes this much more
difficult to remember than these.
