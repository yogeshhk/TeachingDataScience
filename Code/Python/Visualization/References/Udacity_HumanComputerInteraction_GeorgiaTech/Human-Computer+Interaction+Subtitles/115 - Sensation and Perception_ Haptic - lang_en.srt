1
00:00:00,445 --> 00:00:02,540
Morgan's skin can feel things.

2
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:03,860
It can't feel at a distance but

3
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:06,480
it can feel when things
are touching right up against it.

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,960
It can feel a variety of different
types of input, like pressure,

5
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:10,150
vibration and temperature.

6
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:14,790
Like listening, Morgan can't
easily filter out touch feedback.

7
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:18,590
But unlike listening, touch feedback is
generally only available to the person

8
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:22,240
it's touching, so it can be used
to create more personal feedback.

9
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:25,670
Traditionally, touch feedback, or
haptic feedback, has been very natural.

10
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:28,988
Morgan feels the keys go down
as she presses them on keyboard.

11
00:00:28,988 --> 00:00:32,439
But with touchscreens, motion controls
and virtual reality, touch needs to

12
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:35,890
be more and more designed explicitly
into the system if we're to use it.
