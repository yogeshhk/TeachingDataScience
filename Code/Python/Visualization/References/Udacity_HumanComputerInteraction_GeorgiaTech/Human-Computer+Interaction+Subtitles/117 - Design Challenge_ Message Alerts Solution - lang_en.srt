1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:02,410
Here's one possible design.

2
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:05,340
We know that smartphones have
cameras and light sensors on them.

3
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:07,410
We can use that to determine
where the phone is,

4
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:09,490
and what kind of alert
it should trigger.

5
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:12,670
If the sensor detects light, that means
the screen is visible, so it might alert

6
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:15,210
her simply by flashing its flashlight or
illuminating the screen.

7
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:17,670
If the sensor does not detect light,

8
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:21,040
it would infer that the phone is in her
pocket and thus, would vibrate instead.

9
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:23,230
Now, of course, this isn't perfect.

10
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:25,950
It could be in her purse, or
she could have put it face down.

11
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:27,630
That's why we iterate
on a design like this,

12
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:29,840
to improve it based on
the user's experiences.
