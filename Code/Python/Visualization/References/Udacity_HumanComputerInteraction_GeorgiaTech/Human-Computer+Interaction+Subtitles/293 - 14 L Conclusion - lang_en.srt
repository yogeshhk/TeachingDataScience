00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:06,150
In this lesson, we've talked about research ethics.

2
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:08,580
Research ethics guide the human subjects research we do

3
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:11,010
to make sure we're respecting the rights of our participants,

4
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:14,190
but it also makes sure the data we're gathering is good and useful.

5
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:16,260
At every stage of our design life cycle,

6
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:19,380
we want to keep respect for our participants at the forefront of our thoughts.

7
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:23,655
That means being wary of experimenting in ways that might negatively affect users.

8
00:00:23,655 --> 00:00:25,770
That also means only asking users to dedicate

9
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:28,980
their time to evaluating interfaces that are well thought out,

10
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:33,510
and that means respecting user's viewpoints and position in the design process.
