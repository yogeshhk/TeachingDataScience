00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,820
Let's talk about challenge of
designing for social relationships.

2
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:05,390
I like to play video games.

3
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:07,020
I'm friends with people from work.

4
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:09,640
So it's natural that I might want to
play games with people from work.

5
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:11,100
But at the same time,

6
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:13,850
my relationship with people
from work isn't purely social.

7
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:15,640
If they see I'm playing a game,
maybe they say,

8
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:17,520
hey, David's got some free time.

9
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,340
I should ask him to help
me out with something.

10
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:22,190
Or if they see I spend a lot of time
playing video games, maybe they more

11
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:26,200
generally say hey, David's got plenty
of time to take on a new tasks.

12
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,670
How do we design a social
video gaming system

13
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:31,360
that nonetheless protects against
these kinds of perceptions?
