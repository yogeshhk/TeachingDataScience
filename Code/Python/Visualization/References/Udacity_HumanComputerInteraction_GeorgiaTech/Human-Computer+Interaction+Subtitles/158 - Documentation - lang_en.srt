00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:04,920
Finally, Nielsen has one last heuristic
regarding user error, documentation.

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:06,820
I put this last for a reason,

3
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:10,920
one goal of usable design is to avoid
the need for documentation altogether.

4
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:14,230
We want users to just interact
naturally with our interfaces.

5
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:17,530
In modern design, we probably can't rely
on users reading our documentation at

6
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:20,880
all unless they're being required
to use our interface altogether.

7
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,390
And Nielsen generally agrees.

8
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:25,130
He writes that even though it's better
if the system can be used without

9
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:29,810
documentation, it may be necessary
to provide help and documentation.

10
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:33,685
Any such information should be easy
to search, focused on user's task,

11
00:00:33,685 --> 00:00:37,565
list concrete steps to be carried out,
and not be too large.

12
00:00:37,565 --> 00:00:40,805
I feel modern design as a whole has made
great strides in this direction over

13
00:00:40,805 --> 00:00:42,175
the past several years.

14
00:00:42,175 --> 00:00:44,655
Nowadays, most often,
when you use documentation online or

15
00:00:44,655 --> 00:00:48,202
wherever you might find it,
it's framed in terms of tasks.

16
00:00:48,202 --> 00:00:49,772
You input what you want to do, and

17
00:00:49,772 --> 00:00:52,712
it gives you a concrete list of
steps to actually carry it out.

18
00:00:52,712 --> 00:00:55,242
That's a refreshing change
compared to older documentation,

19
00:00:55,242 --> 00:00:58,932
which was more dedicated to just listing
out everything a given interface could

20
00:00:58,932 --> 00:01:02,052
do without any consideration to what
you were actually trying to do.
