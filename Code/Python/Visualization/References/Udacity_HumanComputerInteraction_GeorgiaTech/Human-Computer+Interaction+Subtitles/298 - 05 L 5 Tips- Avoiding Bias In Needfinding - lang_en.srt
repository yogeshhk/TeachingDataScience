1
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:06,600
During need-finding, there are some significant considerations that

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:09,765
need to be made to avoid biasing your results.

3
00:00:09,765 --> 00:00:12,300
Let's go through five of these possible biases.

4
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:15,165
Number one, confirmation bias.

5
00:00:15,165 --> 00:00:18,630
Confirmation bias is the phenomenon where we see what we want to see.

6
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:21,570
We enter with some preconceived ideas of what we'll see and

7
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:24,735
we only notice the things that confirm our prior beliefs.

8
00:00:24,735 --> 00:00:28,185
Try to avoid this by specifically looking for signs that you're wrong,

9
00:00:28,185 --> 00:00:30,060
by testing your beliefs empirically,

10
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:33,795
and by involving multiple individuals in the need-finding process.

11
00:00:33,795 --> 00:00:36,625
Number two, observer bias.

12
00:00:36,625 --> 00:00:38,550
When we're interacting directly with users,

13
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:40,700
we may subconsciously bias them.

14
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:42,230
We might be more helpful, for example,

15
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:43,760
with users using the interface that we

16
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,555
designed compared to the ones that other people designed.

17
00:00:46,555 --> 00:00:49,010
On surveys, we might accidentally phrase questions in

18
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:52,085
a way that elicits the answers that we want to hear.

19
00:00:52,085 --> 00:00:56,330
Try to avoid this by separating experimenters with motives from the participants,

20
00:00:56,330 --> 00:00:58,820
by heavily scripting interactions with users,

21
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:00,230
and by having someone else review

22
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:03,604
your interview scripts and your surveys for leading questions.

23
00:01:03,604 --> 00:01:07,100
Number three, social desirability bias.

24
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:10,015
People tend to be nice, people want to help.

25
00:01:10,015 --> 00:01:12,110
If you're testing an interface and the participants

26
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:14,135
know that you're the designer of the interface,

27
00:01:14,135 --> 00:01:16,940
they'll want to say something nice about it to make you happy,

28
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:19,595
but that gets in the way of getting good data.

29
00:01:19,595 --> 00:01:23,075
Try to avoid this by hiding what the socially desirable response

30
00:01:23,075 --> 00:01:28,145
is by conducting more naturalistic observations and by recording objective data.

31
00:01:28,145 --> 00:01:31,715
Number four, voluntary response bias.

32
00:01:31,715 --> 00:01:34,280
Studies have shown that people with stronger opinions are

33
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:36,890
more likely to respond to optional surveys.

34
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:39,300
You can see this often in online store reviews.

35
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:42,670
The most common responses are often fives and ones.

36
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:46,430
For us, that means if we prefer quantitative analysis on surveys,

37
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:49,820
we risk oversampling the more extreme views.

38
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:51,770
Avoid this by limiting how much of

39
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:54,650
the survey content is shown to users before they begin survey,

40
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:57,785
and by confirming any conclusions with other methods.

41
00:01:57,785 --> 00:02:00,650
Number five, Recall bias.

42
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:05,080
Studies have also shown that people aren't always very good at recalling what they did,

43
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:09,245
what they thought or how they felt during an activity they completed in the past.

44
00:02:09,245 --> 00:02:12,185
That can lead to misleading and incorrect data.

45
00:02:12,185 --> 00:02:16,160
Try to avoid this by studying casks and contexts by having users think out

46
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:20,225
loud during activities or conducting interviews during the activity itself.

47
00:02:20,225 --> 00:02:23,390
Now, these biases can be largely controlled also

48
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:26,670
by making sure to engage in multiple forms of need-finding.
