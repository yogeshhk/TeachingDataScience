00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:08,385
In designing evaluations, it's critical that we define what we're evaluating.

2
00:00:08,385 --> 00:00:11,310
Without that, we generally tend to bottom out

3
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:14,430
in vague assessments about whether or not users like our interface.

4
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:18,870
So, here are five quick tips on what you might choose to evaluate.

5
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:21,600
Number one, efficiency.

6
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,825
How long does it take users to accomplish certain tasks?

7
00:00:24,825 --> 00:00:28,230
That's one of the classic metrics for evaluating interfaces.

8
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:33,065
Can one interface accomplish a task in pure actions or in less time than another?

9
00:00:33,065 --> 00:00:35,600
You might test this with predictive models or you might

10
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,840
actually time users in completing these tasks.

11
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:42,740
Still though, this paints a pretty narrow picture of usability.

12
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:45,410
Number two, accuracy.

13
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:48,845
How many errors do users commit while accomplishing a task?

14
00:00:48,845 --> 00:00:51,470
That's typically a pretty empirical question

15
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:53,740
although we can address it qualitatively as well.

16
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:56,570
Ideally, we want an interface that reduces

17
00:00:56,570 --> 00:00:59,690
the number of errors a user commits while performing a task.

18
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:02,150
Both efficiency and accuracy, however,

19
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:06,049
examined the narrow setting of an expert user using an interface.

20
00:01:06,049 --> 00:01:07,955
So, that brings us to our next metric.

21
00:01:07,955 --> 00:01:10,625
Number three, learnability.

22
00:01:10,625 --> 00:01:13,085
Sit under user down in front of the interface.

23
00:01:13,085 --> 00:01:15,860
Define some standard for expertise.

24
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:19,720
How long does it take the user to hit that level of expertise?

25
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:22,640
Expertise here might range from performing

26
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,195
a particular action to something like creating an entire document.

27
00:01:26,195 --> 00:01:29,110
Number four, memorability.

28
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:30,760
Similar to learnability,

29
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:35,420
memorability refers to the user's ability to remember how to use an interface over time.

30
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:37,670
Imagine you have a user alone in an interface,

31
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:39,965
then leave and come back a week later.

32
00:01:39,965 --> 00:01:41,860
How much do they remember?

33
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:45,290
Ideally, you want interfaces that need only be learned once,

34
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:47,555
which means high memorability.

35
00:01:47,555 --> 00:01:50,600
Number five, satisfaction.

36
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,580
When we forget to look at our other metrics,

37
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:55,720
we bought them out in a general notion of satisfaction.

38
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,725
But that doesn't mean it's unimportant.

39
00:01:57,725 --> 00:02:00,065
We do need to operationalize it though.

40
00:02:00,065 --> 00:02:03,020
Experience is things like uses enjoyment of

41
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:06,595
the system or the cognitive load they experience while using the system.

42
00:02:06,595 --> 00:02:08,780
To avoid social desirability bias,

43
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:12,230
we might want to evaluate this in creative ways like finding out,

44
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:16,550
how many participants actually download an app they tested after the session is over?

45
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:18,830
Regardless of what you choose to evaluate,

46
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:22,010
it's important that you very clearly articulate at the beginning,

47
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:24,650
what you're evaluating, what data you're gathering,

48
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:26,885
and what analysis you will use.

49
00:02:26,885 --> 00:02:31,130
These three things should match up to address your research questions.
