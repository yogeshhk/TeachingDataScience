1
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:08,370
Design alternatives are where you explore different ways to facilitate the users task.

2
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:11,339
If you've already chosen to focus on a certain area of technology

3
00:00:11,339 --> 00:00:14,160
like wearable devices or gestural interaction,

4
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,380
then in some ways you've put the cart before the horse.

5
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:19,800
You've chosen your design before exploring the problem.

6
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,530
As a learning experience though, that's perfectly fine.

7
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:24,600
It's fine to say, I want to explore

8
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,080
augmented reality and I'm going to find a task that lets me do that.

9
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:29,550
You're still exploring whether or

10
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:32,385
not augmented reality is the right solution for that task.

11
00:00:32,385 --> 00:00:34,395
You're just altering the task if not,

12
00:00:34,395 --> 00:00:36,705
instead of altering the design, if not.

13
00:00:36,705 --> 00:00:39,950
For other domains, you might need to make sure to create personas

14
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:43,055
for different stakeholders in health care for instance.

15
00:00:43,055 --> 00:00:47,000
You would want to make sure any interface you design takes into consideration nurses,

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,955
doctors, patients, managers, family members, and more.

17
00:00:49,955 --> 00:00:53,030
So, do you want to create personas for all those different types of people as

18
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:56,870
well and make sure to explore scenarios that affect each stakeholder.
