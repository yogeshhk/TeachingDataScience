1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,040
Institutional review boards
govern any research institutions

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:06,230
that receive support from
the federal government.

3
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:09,150
But what about research that doesn't
receive any federal support?

4
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:12,850
Very often, companies will
do research on their users.

5
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:15,100
This is especially common in HCI.

6
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:18,040
Lots of companies are constantly
doing very interesting testing on

7
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:21,370
their users with a lot
of rapid AB experiments.

8
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:24,580
There's a lot of potential knowledge
there, but at the same time

9
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:29,740
much of what they do likely would not
pass IRB if it were university research.

10
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:32,400
This actually came up recently
with Facebook in a paper they

11
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:37,030
published titled experimental evidence
of massive-scale emotional contagion

12
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:38,850
through social networks.

13
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:41,750
Basically, Facebook wanted to see if
they could predict what would make

14
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:43,560
users happy or sad.

15
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:45,790
And as a result they
tweaked the news feed for

16
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:48,210
some users to test out their ideas.

17
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:51,970
In other words, they tried to
manipulate their user's mood for

18
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:53,910
experimental purposes.

19
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:56,770
Now, Facebook argues that this
was consistent with their

20
00:00:56,770 --> 00:01:01,310
own data use policy, which permits
them to perform experiments like this.

21
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:05,120
Some social scientists however would
argue that this does not constitute

22
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,600
informed consent.

23
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:10,930
Informed consent they say is specific
to a certain experiment, temporary for

24
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:14,150
a known period of time and
given without coercion.

25
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:17,350
Some would argue that if you don't
agree you can't use Facebook

26
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:19,150
qualifies as coercion.

27
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:22,860
These are some difficult issues and
if you end up working in HCI industry,

28
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:25,000
you'll likely find yourself
wrestling with some of them.
