1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:02,714
Personally, I think three of
these are good questions.

2
00:00:02,714 --> 00:00:06,134
Do you exercise, is not a great
question, because it's kind of a yes or

3
00:00:06,134 --> 00:00:07,540
no question.

4
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:08,640
How often do you exercise,

5
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:10,946
is actually the better way
of asking the same question.

6
00:00:10,946 --> 00:00:15,490
It's subsumes all the answers to do
you exercise, but leaves more room for

7
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:18,080
elaboration or more room for detail.

8
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:21,000
Do you exercise for health or for
pleasure, is not a great question,

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,670
because it presents to
the user a dichotomy.

10
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:26,270
It might not be the way they
actually think about the problem.

11
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:27,899
Maybe there's some other
reason they exercise.

12
00:00:27,899 --> 00:00:30,280
Maybe they do it to be social,
for example.

13
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:33,690
We want to leave open all
the possibilities a user might have.

14
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:36,173
So instead of asking,
do you exercise for health or

15
00:00:36,173 --> 00:00:39,199
for pleasure, we probably want to ask,
why do you exercise?

16
00:00:39,199 --> 00:00:42,681
The next two questions work pretty well,
because they leave plenty of room for

17
00:00:42,681 --> 00:00:45,001
the participant to have
a wide range of answers, and

18
00:00:45,001 --> 00:00:47,850
they're not leading them
towards any particular answer.

19
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:51,030
We're not asking, for example,
what smartphone do you use to listen to

20
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:53,640
something, because maybe
they don't use a smartphone.

21
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,220
This sixth one is interesting.

22
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:58,570
We're developing an app for listening
to audiobooks while exercising.

23
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:00,290
Would that be interesting to you?

24
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:01,890
What's wrong with that question?

25
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:04,170
When we say, we're developing an app,

26
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:07,250
we introduce something called
social desirability bias.

27
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:09,321
Because we're the ones
developing the app,

28
00:01:09,321 --> 00:01:12,932
the user is going to feel some pressure
to agree with us, to support our ideas.

29
00:01:12,932 --> 00:01:14,412
People like to support one another.

30
00:01:14,412 --> 00:01:17,454
And so even if they wouldn't
be interested, they'll likely

31
00:01:17,454 --> 00:01:20,905
say that they would, because that's
the supportive thing to say.

32
00:01:20,905 --> 00:01:24,465
No one wants to say, hey, great idea,
David, but I would never use it.

33
00:01:24,465 --> 00:01:27,910
So what we want to make sure to
do is create no incentive for

34
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:31,080
a user to not give us the complete,
honest answer.

35
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:33,870
Worrying about hurting our
feelings is one reason

36
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:35,780
why they wouldn't be totally honest.

37
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:39,520
So we might reword this question just to
say, would you be interested in an app

38
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,250
for listening to audiobooks
while exercising?

39
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:45,620
Now granted, the fact that we're the
ones asking still probably will tip off

40
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:49,260
the user that we're probably thinking
about moving in that direction, but

41
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:52,050
at least it's going to be
a little more collaborative.

42
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:54,630
We're not tipping them off that
we're already planning to do this,

43
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:57,440
we're telling them that we might
be thinking about doing it.

44
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:00,500
And so if they don't think it's a good
idea, they kind of feel like they should

45
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:03,100
tell us right now,
to save us time down the road.

46
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:05,850
So by rephrasing the question that way,
we hopefully,

47
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:08,650
avoid biasing the participant to
just agree with us to be nice.
