00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,390
Let's try a quick exercise
on direct manipulation.

2
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:04,615
The Mac touchpad is famous for

3
00:00:04,615 --> 00:00:06,973
facilitating a lot of different
kinds of interactions.

4
00:00:06,973 --> 00:00:12,452
For example, I can press on it to click,
press the two fingers to right-click.

5
00:00:12,452 --> 00:00:15,570
I can pull up and down with two
fingers to scroll up and down.

6
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:20,900
I can double tap with two fingers
to scroll in and out a little bit.

7
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:24,000
And I can pinch to zoom in and
out a lot more.

8
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:28,170
Which of these are good examples
of direct manipulation in action?
