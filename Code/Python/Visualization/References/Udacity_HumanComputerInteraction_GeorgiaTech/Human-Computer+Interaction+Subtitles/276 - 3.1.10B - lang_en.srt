1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,250
Just as there are different types of quantitative data,

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:05,055
so also there are different types of qualitative data.

3
00:00:05,055 --> 00:00:08,940
In practice though, the types of qualitative data we generate are

4
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:12,885
usually much more closely integrated with the way in which they were generated.

5
00:00:12,885 --> 00:00:15,210
For example, we could have discrete ratio data that

6
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:17,730
comes from self-reported responses on a survey,

7
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:19,800
or naturalistic observations in the wild,

8
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,885
or logs from real interfaces.

9
00:00:21,885 --> 00:00:23,670
Qualitative data, on the other hand,

10
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:26,415
tends to be determined more by how it's gathered.

11
00:00:26,415 --> 00:00:28,845
Some common types of qualitative data we'll deal with

12
00:00:28,845 --> 00:00:32,300
are transcripts from things like interviews and focus groups,

13
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:36,440
field notes we might take during naturalistic or participant observation,

14
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:38,510
artifacts like reviews left for

15
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:41,404
existing interfaces or the existing interfaces themselves,

16
00:00:41,404 --> 00:00:43,145
and lots, lots more.

17
00:00:43,145 --> 00:00:45,290
Quantitative data is numeric data,

18
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:47,885
and qualitative data is everything else.

19
00:00:47,885 --> 00:00:51,870
So, the span of possible qualitative data is a lot larger.

20
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:54,380
The qualitative data is strong because these types of data

21
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:57,290
provide a much richer picture of what we're investigating.

22
00:00:57,290 --> 00:00:59,680
But with that strength comes some costs.

23
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,470
Qualitative data is also more expensive to analyze,

24
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:05,915
and it's also a lot more prone to interpretation biases.

25
00:01:05,915 --> 00:01:07,760
So, for that reason, we often convert

26
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:11,450
qualitative data to quantitative data for the purpose of analysis.

27
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:13,925
We do this through a process called coding.

28
00:01:13,925 --> 00:01:17,855
Now here, coding isn't writing Python code or doing anything like that.

29
00:01:17,855 --> 00:01:19,490
Coding is a process of taking

30
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:24,340
free foreign qualitative data and boiling it down into some numeric categories.

31
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:26,245
Typically, these categories are nominal,

32
00:01:26,245 --> 00:01:28,550
which allows us to do whatever kind of statistical test

33
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:31,220
we can do on nominal quantitative data.

34
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:35,245
During this process, we lose some of that rich data.

35
00:01:35,245 --> 00:01:39,320
But what we gain is a numeric representation that we can use in new ways,

36
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:41,660
and plus we didn't really lose that original data.

37
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:44,720
It's just not part of the output of this coding process.

38
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:47,150
So, we can still go back and look at it if we need to.

39
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:49,490
The other thing that comes out of this process is

40
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:53,860
a documented methodology for actually coding the qualitative data to quantitative data.

41
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:56,840
So, if anyone asks where we got these numbers,

42
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:59,140
we can actually show them the process we went through.

43
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:01,640
That helps us argue that our interpretations are not

44
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:04,370
just biased interpretations of what happened,

45
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:07,895
but they are actually rigorous analyses based on that qualitative data.

46
00:02:07,895 --> 00:02:11,855
In HCI., we almost always want to use some mix of these two.

47
00:02:11,855 --> 00:02:15,920
Our problems are far too rich to address with quantitative data alone,

48
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,510
but for that same reason,

49
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:22,890
we risk being dominated by biases if we focus solely on qualitative analysis.
