00:00:05,781 --> 00:00:09,205
In discussing a human-computer
interaction, there's often a tendency

3
00:00:09,205 --> 00:00:11,986
to look narrowly at the user
interacting with the computer.

4
00:00:11,986 --> 00:00:15,141
Or slightly more broadly at the user
interacting with the task through some

5
00:00:15,141 --> 00:00:16,430
computer.

6
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:20,070
But many times we're interested
in zooming even further out.

7
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:23,144
We're interested, not only in
the interaction between the human,

8
00:00:23,144 --> 00:00:24,522
the computer and the task, but

9
00:00:24,522 --> 00:00:27,180
also in the context in which
that interaction takes place.

10
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:30,315
So today we're going to look at
four different models or theories,

11
00:00:30,315 --> 00:00:31,860
of the context surrounding ACI.

12
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:35,080
We'll focus primarily on
distributed cognition,

13
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:38,640
which is one of the dominant theories on
the interplay between multiple agents,

14
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,800
artifacts, and contexts.

15
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,180
We'll also touch on three
other significant theories,

16
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:46,240
social cognition, situated action,
and activity theory.
