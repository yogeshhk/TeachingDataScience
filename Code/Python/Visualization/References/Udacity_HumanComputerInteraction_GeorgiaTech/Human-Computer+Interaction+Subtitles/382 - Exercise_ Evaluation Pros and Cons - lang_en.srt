1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,420
In this lesson, we've covered three
different types of evaluation.

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:06,150
Qualitative, empirical, and predictive.

3
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:09,020
Each method has its advantages and
disadvantages.

4
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:11,720
Let's start to wrap this lesson
up by exploring those advantages

5
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:12,300
with an exercise.

6
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:14,370
Here are the methods that we've covered.

7
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:16,400
And here are some potential advantages.

8
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:20,210
For each row, mark the column
to which that advantage applies.

9
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:22,200
Note that again,
these might be somewhat relative, so

10
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:24,790
your answer will probably
differ a bit from ours.

11
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:25,310
You can go ahead and

12
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:27,780
skip to the exercise if you don't
want to hear me read these.

13
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:28,880
Our advantages are,

14
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:33,270
does not require any actual users,
identifies provable advantages.

15
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:35,690
Informs ongoing design decisions,

16
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:38,330
investigates the participants
thought process.

17
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:41,050
Provides generalizable conclusions, and

18
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:43,390
draws conclusions from
actual participants.
