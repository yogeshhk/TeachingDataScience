00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:03,930
We'll talk extensively about the idea
of disappearing interfaces and

2
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:05,670
designing with tasks in mind.

3
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:06,700
But in all likelihood,

4
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:10,057
you've used computers enough to already
have some experience in this area.

5
00:00:10,057 --> 00:00:10,989
So take a moment and

6
00:00:10,989 --> 00:00:14,660
reflect on some of the tasks you
do each day involving computers.

7
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:17,250
Try to think of an example where you
spend most of your time thinking about

8
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:18,340
the task and

9
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:20,960
an example where you spend most of
your time thinking about the tool.
