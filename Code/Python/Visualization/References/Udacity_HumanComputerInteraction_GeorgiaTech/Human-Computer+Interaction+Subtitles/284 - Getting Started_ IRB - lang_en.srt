1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,590
After you've completed
any necessary training

2
00:00:02,590 --> 00:00:05,700
you can access the IRB application for
your own university.

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:07,150
We're doing this in
terms of Georgia Tech,

4
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:09,690
so here's the tool we
used called IRBWISE.

5
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,650
Here under my protocols,

6
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:15,550
you'll see a list of all of
the protocols to which you're added.

7
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:19,140
A protocol is a description of
a particular research project.

8
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:22,810
It outlines the procedures that the IRB
has approved regarding consent,

9
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:25,570
recruitment, experimentation and more.

10
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:27,670
Here we see approved protocols.

11
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:29,990
Protocols that are new and
haven't been submitted yet.

12
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:32,310
Protocols that are waiting for
the IRB to act on them.

13
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:33,970
And amendments to protocols.

14
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:38,110
Amendments are how we change earlier
protocols to add new researchers or

15
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:39,990
change what we're approved to do.

16
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:43,530
After a protocol is approved,
any changes must be submitted to the IRB

17
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:45,520
as an amendment to be
accepted separately.
