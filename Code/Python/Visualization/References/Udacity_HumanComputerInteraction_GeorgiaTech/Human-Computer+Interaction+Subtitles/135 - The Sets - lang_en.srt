1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,540
In this lesson, we're going to talk about four sets of design principles.

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:07,740
These aren't the only four sets but are the ones that I see referenced most often,

3
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:10,515
and we'll talk about what some of the others might be at the end of the lesson.

4
00:00:10,515 --> 00:00:12,809
In his book, "The Design of Everyday Things",

5
00:00:12,809 --> 00:00:15,705
Don Norman outlined his famous six design principles.

6
00:00:15,705 --> 00:00:18,660
This is probably the most famous set of design principles out there.

7
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:21,770
The more recent versions of the book actually have a seventh principle.

8
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:24,880
But that seventh principle was actually one of our entire lessons.

9
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:30,130
Jakob Nielsen outlines 10 design heuristics in his book, "Usability Inspection Methods".

10
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:32,690
Many of Norman's principles are similar to Nielsen's,

11
00:00:32,690 --> 00:00:34,110
but there's some unique ones as well.

12
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:36,410
What's interesting is Norman and Nielsen went

13
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:39,055
into business together and form the Nielsen Norman Group,

14
00:00:39,055 --> 00:00:40,770
which is for user experience, training,

15
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:43,125
consulting in HCI research.

16
00:00:43,125 --> 00:00:45,295
In their books, "Software for Use",

17
00:00:45,295 --> 00:00:48,710
Larry Constantine and Lucy Lockwood outline an additional six principles.

18
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:50,900
Again, many of them overlap with these two,

19
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:52,045
but some of them are unique.

20
00:00:52,045 --> 00:00:53,660
Finally, Ronald Mace of

21
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:57,545
North Carolina State University proposed seven principles of universal design.

22
00:00:57,545 --> 00:00:59,690
The Center for Excellence in universal design,

23
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:01,760
whose mobile site is presented here,

24
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,010
has continued research into this area.

25
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:05,600
These are a little bit different than

26
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,135
the heuristics and principles presented in the other three.

27
00:01:08,135 --> 00:01:11,000
While these three are most concerned with usability in general,

28
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,150
universal design is specifically concerned with designing

29
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:17,675
interfaces and devices that can be used by everyone regardless of age,

30
00:01:17,675 --> 00:01:19,310
disability, and so on.

31
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:21,650
To make this lesson a little easier to follow,

32
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:25,190
I've tried to merge these four sets of principles into one larger set,

33
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:27,465
capturing the overlap between many of them.

34
00:01:27,465 --> 00:01:30,780
In this lesson, we'll go through these 15 principles.

35
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:32,840
These principles are intended to distill out

36
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:35,420
some of the overlap between those different sets.

37
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:38,570
This table shows those 15 principles.

38
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:40,110
My names for each of them,

39
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:42,020
and which sets that come from.

40
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:43,910
Note that my 15 principles are

41
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:47,030
just an abstraction or summary of these sets of principles,

42
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:49,370
and you should make sure to understand the sets themselves as well.

43
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:50,930
There are some subtle differences between

44
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:53,300
the principles I've grouped together from different sets,

45
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:55,435
and we'll talk about those as we go forward.

46
00:01:55,435 --> 00:01:59,345
Again, note that these aren't the only four sets of design principles out there.

47
00:01:59,345 --> 00:02:01,565
At the end of the lesson, we'll chat about a few more,

48
00:02:01,565 --> 00:02:04,990
and we'll also mention when others apply within this lesson as well.
