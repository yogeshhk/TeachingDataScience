1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:03,540
After the perception portion of this
model comes the cognition portion,

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:05,160
starting with memory.

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:07,490
There are lots of different
models of memory out there.

4
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:10,510
For our purposes we're going to talk
about three different kinds of memory,

5
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:13,950
the perceptual store or working memory,
the short-term memory, and

6
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:15,340
the long term memory.

7
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:17,990
Some scientists argue that there
are other types of memory as well,

8
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:20,920
like an intermediate sort
of back of the mind memory.

9
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:24,920
But the greatest consensus is around the
existence of at least these three kinds.

10
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:28,690
So let's start with the first, the
perceptual store or the working memory.

11
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:32,810
The perceptual store is a very short
term memory lasting less than a second.

12
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:35,940
One of the most common models of
working memory came from Baddeley and

13
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:36,800
Hitch in 1974.

14
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,230
They described it as having three parts.

15
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:43,750
First, there's the visuospatial
sketchpad which holds visual information

16
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:45,760
for active manipulation.

17
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,180
So for example, picture a pencil.

18
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:51,940
The visuospatial sketchpad is where
you're currently seeing that pencil.

19
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:54,780
A second part is the phonological loop.

20
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:58,760
The phonological loop is similar, but
for verbal or auditory information.

21
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:00,960
It stores the sounds or
speech you've heard recently,

22
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,280
such as the sound of me
talking to you right now.

23
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:06,590
A third part is the episodic buffer.

24
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:09,550
The episodic buffer takes care of
integrating information from the other

25
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:13,780
systems as well as chronological
ordering to put things in place.

26
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:17,360
Finally all three of these
are coordinated by a central executive.

27
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,170
So let's try an example of this.

28
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:23,810
I'm going to very quickly show you a
picture and ask you a question about it.

29
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:27,750
Don't focus on any particular portion of
the picture, try to view it as a whole.

30
00:01:31,528 --> 00:01:32,850
What was the score on the scoreboard?
