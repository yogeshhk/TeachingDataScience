1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:03,530
The problem is that we're not
focused on the right task.

2
00:00:03,530 --> 00:00:06,620
Our task shouldn't be to swipe a credit
card, or insert a credit card, or

3
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:07,700
anything like that.

4
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:11,120
Our task should be how to most
easily pay for purchases.

5
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:13,790
And possibly the easiest way to do that
would be to design a system that lets

6
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:17,420
you just tap your phone against the
reader, this reader actually does that.

7
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:21,120
That way, we can use the thing that
people have on them at all times.

8
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:22,468
Now maybe that's isn't
the best option for

9
00:00:22,468 --> 00:00:25,620
various other reasons, but the important
thing is we need to focus on what we're

10
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:27,180
really trying to accomplish.

11
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:29,060
Not just how we've done it in the past.

12
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:31,400
We can make incremental improvements
just sliding or swiping or

13
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,160
inserting a credit card all we want.

14
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:35,760
But we should always keep our
eyes on the underlying task

15
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,220
that the user needs to accomplish.
