1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,570
One of the most important elements
of IRB approval is consent,

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:06,720
that was one of the things
created by the Belmont Report.

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:09,290
If we're doing any interaction
with our human subjects,

4
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:12,070
we definitely need to think
about consent procedures.

5
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:14,270
On the consent information page, first,

6
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:17,640
we need to indicate what kind
of consent we'll receive.

7
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:20,640
Most commonly,
this will be written consent required.

8
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,730
In this case, participants will sign or
digitally sign,

9
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:29,060
a consent form to start the study, but
in some cases a waiver may be obtained.

10
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:31,790
First, a waiver of consent can
be obtained under certain,

11
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:33,680
pretty narrow circumstances,

12
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:37,910
this generally means we don't need to
receive the subject's consent at all.

13
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:40,840
Most of the time this only applies
when subjects will not be directly

14
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,430
affected by the research.

15
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:44,840
So for example,
if we wanted to study educational or

16
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:47,310
health data that's already
been generated and

17
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:50,710
is already anonymized,
we might receive a waiver of consent.

18
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:53,470
Because those subjects won't be
impacted by the fact we're now

19
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:54,990
researching their data.

20
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:58,122
Similarly, if we were to go sit in
a coffee house and just take notes on

21
00:00:58,122 --> 00:01:01,039
the order taking process in a way
that didn't identify anyone.

22
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:02,944
We might receive a waiver of consent,

23
00:01:02,944 --> 00:01:06,710
because our observation is
not affecting those people.

24
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:10,290
We might also receive a waiver
of documentation of consent.

25
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:13,960
This occurs for low risk research,
where the written consent itself,

26
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:16,570
would be the only record of
the participants identity.

27
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:20,420
This applies to a lot of survey
research or unrecorded interviews,

28
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:23,280
where participants can be informed
of their rights at the start, and

29
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,950
their own continued participation
constitutes continued implied consent.

30
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:31,210
There's no reason to have them sign a
consent form, because that consent form

31
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:35,110
is the only reason we'd ever be able
to identify them after the study.

32
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:36,210
After selecting our option,

33
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:39,600
we need to provide a justification,
if we requested a waiver.

34
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,400
If we didn't,
then no justification is necessary.

35
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,730
We'll then describe the plan for
obtaining informed consent.

36
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:48,700
Generally, this will be to provide
the consent form to participants

37
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:50,180
at the start of a study, and

38
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:53,260
make it very clear that they can
withdraw from the study at any time.

39
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:56,750
If we're involving children,
non english speakers or other at risk

40
00:01:56,750 --> 00:02:00,390
populations in our study, there may
be some additional boxes to complete.

41
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:01,410
It's also important for

42
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:04,590
us to assess whether participants
are continuing to consent to the study.

43
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,660
Often times, we do this by making it
very clear at the start of the study

44
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:10,460
that they can withdraw at any time.

45
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:14,170
So that their continued participation
constitutes implied continued consent.

46
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:18,880
Finally, it's also possible to
have protocols where deception or

47
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,850
concealment is proposed.

48
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:24,340
In HCI, for example, we might want to
tell participants that an interface is

49
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:27,555
functioning even if someone behind the
scenes is actually just making it look

50
00:02:27,555 --> 00:02:31,155
functional, so that we get good research
data out of those participants.

51
00:02:31,155 --> 00:02:34,565
For example, if we were testing
something like a new version of Siri,

52
00:02:34,565 --> 00:02:36,735
we might tell participants
that it's functioning,

53
00:02:36,735 --> 00:02:39,155
when in reality someone is
writing the responses by hand.

54
00:02:40,225 --> 00:02:44,245
If we're using deception or concealment
like that, we'll indicate so here.

55
00:02:44,245 --> 00:02:47,590
Then finally,
we need to upload our consent forms.

56
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:51,540
At Georgia Tech the Office of Research
Integrity Assurance provides consent

57
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:55,420
form templates that we can tweak to
match the specific needs of our study.

58
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:58,860
The templates provide in depth
directions on what to supply.

59
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:02,260
Generally, this is where we disclose
to participants the details of the rest

60
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:03,260
of the protocol.

61
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:07,380
What we're researching, why, how, and
why they were invited to participate?
