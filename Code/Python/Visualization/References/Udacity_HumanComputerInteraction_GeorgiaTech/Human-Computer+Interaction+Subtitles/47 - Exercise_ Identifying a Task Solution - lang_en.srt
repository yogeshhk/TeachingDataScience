1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:02,170
If you said she's
swiping her credit card,

2
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:04,590
you're thinking a little too narrowly.

3
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:08,180
Swiping her credit card is just
how she accomplishes her task.

4
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:11,132
We're interested in something more
like she's completing a purchase.

5
00:00:11,132 --> 00:00:12,445
She's purchasing an item.

6
00:00:12,445 --> 00:00:14,218
She's exchanging goods.

7
00:00:14,218 --> 00:00:17,316
Those all put more emphasis on
the actual task she's accomplishing and

8
00:00:17,316 --> 00:00:20,680
let us think more generally about how
we can make that interface even better.
