00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,910
Here's one example of how you
might design a GOMS model for

2
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:04,760
disabling a security system.

3
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:07,750
Our initial situation is that we're
entering the home with the alarm set and

4
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:10,370
we have two methods for
disabling the alarm.

5
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:13,170
We can use the keypad or
we can use the keychain.

6
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:16,378
Either way, our goal is that
we've entered the home and

7
00:00:16,378 --> 00:00:17,780
reenabled the alarm.

8
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:20,294
Our selection rules might be something
like if we have our hands full,

9
00:00:20,294 --> 00:00:23,380
we're going to use the keypad so that we
can get inside and put the stuff down.

10
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:25,800
But if we don't have our hands full,
we'll use the keychain.

11
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,590
You might come up with other models for
this that have either different methods,

12
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:30,830
different operators,
different selection rules.

13
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:33,890
There are a lot of different ways we
can capture a task with the GOMS model,

14
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:35,630
depending on what you
choose to focus on.
