1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,100
Finally, the highest level of educational achievement in HCI is likely a PhD,

2
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:07,900
specifically in HCI or similar field.

3
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:11,010
Here at Georgia Tech and at schools like Clemson and Maryland,

4
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:15,360
that's a PhD in Human-Centered Computing which is actually what my PhD was in.

5
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:19,065
Other schools have PhDs in similar fields, Carnegie-Mellon,

6
00:00:19,065 --> 00:00:21,180
Iowa State University, IUPUI,

7
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:24,390
and others have PhD programs in HCI specifically.

8
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:28,080
Pursuing a PhD in HCI or HCC lets you take

9
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,950
a deep dive into how humans and computers interact in our modern world.

10
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:34,020
You might dive deep into artificial intelligence,

11
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:38,620
and cognitive science using AI agents to reflect on how humans think.

12
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:41,540
You might delve into learning sciences and technology studying

13
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:45,215
the intersection between computers and education in depth.

14
00:00:45,215 --> 00:00:47,450
You might focus on social computing and

15
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:52,330
how online communities function or how social media is changing our society,

16
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:55,220
or you might stick closer to the core of HCI

17
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:57,980
and focus on how people make sense of new technologies.

18
00:00:57,980 --> 00:00:59,250
You might answer questions like,

19
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:01,760
"How do we give immediate feedback on motion controls?"

20
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:05,420
Or, "How do we adapt a user interface to the user's mood?"

21
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:08,150
There are enormous questions to answer.

22
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:12,750
I'm excited to see some of you move on to change the world in very profound ways.
