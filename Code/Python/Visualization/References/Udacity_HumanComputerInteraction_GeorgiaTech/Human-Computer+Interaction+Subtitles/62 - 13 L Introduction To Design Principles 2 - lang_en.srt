00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:06,690
In this lesson, we've covered some of the basic things you need to

2
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:09,495
understand before we start talking about design principles.

3
00:00:09,495 --> 00:00:13,620
We covered the idea that interfaces mediate between users and tasks,

4
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:15,900
and the best interfaces are those that let the user spend

5
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:18,825
as much time thinking about the task as possible.

6
00:00:18,825 --> 00:00:21,750
We covered the idea of usability and how you have to

7
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:24,900
keep in mind the efficiency and user satisfaction of the interface.

8
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,450
We covered three views of the user and how

9
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:31,245
those different views affect how we define usability and evaluation.

10
00:00:31,245 --> 00:00:34,230
We covered how the user experience does not exist just at the user

11
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:37,610
level but also at group and even societal levels.
