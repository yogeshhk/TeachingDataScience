1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:03,600
If we're designing interfaces for
particularly complex tasks,

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,480
we might quickly find out that just
talking to our participants or

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,400
observing them really isn't enough to
get the understanding we need to design

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:11,710
those interfaces.

5
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:14,655
For particularly complex tasks,
we might need to become

6
00:00:14,655 --> 00:00:17,825
experts ourselves in order
to design those programs.

7
00:00:17,825 --> 00:00:19,995
This is informed by
the domain of ethnography,

8
00:00:19,995 --> 00:00:22,595
which recommends
researching a community or

9
00:00:22,595 --> 00:00:26,245
a job or anything like that,
by becoming a participant in it.

10
00:00:26,245 --> 00:00:28,085
It goes beyond just
participant observation though,

11
00:00:28,085 --> 00:00:31,250
it's really about integrating
oneself into that area and

12
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:34,050
becoming an expert in it and
learning about it as you go.

13
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:38,630
So we bring in our expertise and
design in HCI and use that combined with

14
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:42,110
the expertise that we develop to create
new interfaces for those people.

15
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:45,340
So for example, our video editors
here at Udacity have an incredible

16
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:49,240
incredibly complex workflow involving
multiple programs, multiple workflows,

17
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:52,210
lots of different people and
lots of moving parts.

18
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:54,490
There's no possible way I could
ever sit down with someone for

19
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:58,225
just an hour and get a good enough
picture of what they do, to design

20
00:00:58,225 --> 00:01:01,675
a new interface that will help them out,
I really need to train under them.

21
00:01:01,675 --> 00:01:04,165
I really need to become
an expert at video editing and

22
00:01:04,165 --> 00:01:06,565
recording myself,
in order to help them out.

23
00:01:06,565 --> 00:01:08,815
It's kind of like
an apprenticeship approach.

24
00:01:08,815 --> 00:01:11,145
They would apprentice
me in their field and

25
00:01:11,145 --> 00:01:15,112
I would use the knowledge that I gain to
design new interfaces to help them out.

26
00:01:15,112 --> 00:01:18,272
So ethnography and apprenticeship
are huge fields of research

27
00:01:18,272 --> 00:01:20,142
both on their own and
as they apply to HCI.

28
00:01:20,142 --> 00:01:22,842
So if you're interested
in using that approach

29
00:01:22,842 --> 00:01:24,562
take a look at some of
the resources that we're providing.
