1
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:05,339
To succeed in HCI,

2
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:07,500
you need a good evaluation plan.

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:09,960
In industries like healthcare and education,

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:11,880
that is initially going to involve getting some time with

5
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:14,610
experts outside the real contexts of the task.

6
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:17,430
That's bringing doctors, bringing in nurses,

7
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:18,870
bringing in patients, and

8
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:21,720
exploring their thoughts and the prototypes that you've designed.

9
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,715
In some places like education,

10
00:00:23,715 --> 00:00:27,780
you might be able to evaluate with real users even before the interface is ready.

11
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:29,565
But in others like healthcare,

12
00:00:29,565 --> 00:00:32,700
the sticks are high enough that you'll only want real users using

13
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:36,325
the interface when you're certain of its effectiveness and reliability.

14
00:00:36,325 --> 00:00:40,395
In some emerging areas that we find in multiple questions in evaluation,

15
00:00:40,395 --> 00:00:42,875
take on virtual reality for example,

16
00:00:42,875 --> 00:00:45,995
most people you encounter haven't used virtual reality before.

17
00:00:45,995 --> 00:00:47,650
There's going to be a learning curve.

18
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:51,590
How are you going to determine whether the learning curve is acceptable or not?

19
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:53,510
If the user runs into difficulties,

20
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:56,075
how can you tell if those come from your interface,

21
00:00:56,075 --> 00:00:59,575
or if they're part of the fundamental VR learning experience?

22
00:00:59,575 --> 00:01:01,490
So, take a moment to brainstorm

23
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:04,745
your evaluation approach for your chosen application area.

24
00:01:04,745 --> 00:01:08,250
What kinds of evaluations would you choose, and why?
