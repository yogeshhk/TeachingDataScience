1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,230
HCI is a popular topic and emerging MOOCs as well.

2
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:05,910
So if you're looking to continue your HCI education in

3
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:10,095
a slightly more formal way but don't want to shell out the money for a formal degree,

4
00:00:10,095 --> 00:00:12,120
there are a lot of great places you can start.

5
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:16,800
First, interactiondesign.org is a treasure trove of HCI information.

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,875
It has a fantastic free open access body of literature to study independently,

7
00:00:20,875 --> 00:00:24,855
including additional information on many topics we've covered throughout this course.

8
00:00:24,855 --> 00:00:28,680
The site also runs quite a few of its own closed courses as well.

9
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:30,270
For more traditional MOOCs,

10
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:34,290
Udacity has free courses on HCI as applies to product design

11
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:38,470
and mobile app design as well as a MOOC by Don Norman based on his famous book,

12
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:40,305
Design of Everyday Things.

13
00:00:40,305 --> 00:00:43,430
Over at edX.org, MIT has released a series of

14
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:46,555
MOOCs targeting user experiences in mobile app development.

15
00:00:46,555 --> 00:00:51,680
The University of Michigan has an X series on UX research and Shanghai University has

16
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:57,310
a course on user experience design with a special emphasis on human factors and culture.

17
00:00:57,310 --> 00:01:01,320
On Coursera, Scott Klemmer one of the most prominent HCI researchers,

18
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:04,360
has a specialization entitled, Interaction Design.

19
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:06,860
The University of Minnesota also has a specialization

20
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:09,380
on UI design that covers a lot of the same topics

21
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:14,150
that we covered here developed in part by another Georgia Tech along [inaudible].

22
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:18,345
The University of London also has a specialization on responsive web design.

23
00:01:18,345 --> 00:01:20,570
Georgia Tech is planning on a specialization on

24
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:24,550
human computer interaction as well that might be live by the time you see this.

25
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:27,390
That's all just core HCI courses.

26
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:29,450
All of these providers and more have courses on

27
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:32,240
applied areas of HCI like video game design,

28
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,330
educational technology, virtual reality and more.

29
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:38,530
Most of these courses are available for free to watch.

30
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:41,210
Note also that new MOOCs are coming online all the time,

31
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:43,895
so there are quite likely a lot that I haven't mentioned here.

32
00:01:43,895 --> 00:01:45,500
So, check out Udacity,

33
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:48,380
checkout edX, checkout Coursera, checkout FutureLearn.

34
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:51,530
Also Checkout classcentral.com for a list of MOOCs

35
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:55,250
across several different platforms or just google "HCI MOOC".

36
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:59,405
This space is so new and fast-paced that by the time you view this video,

37
00:01:59,405 --> 00:02:01,280
half the MOOCs I've mentioned might be gone

38
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,635
and twice as many new ones may have been created.

39
00:02:03,635 --> 00:02:07,550
We'll try to keep an updated list of available courses in the notes below.
