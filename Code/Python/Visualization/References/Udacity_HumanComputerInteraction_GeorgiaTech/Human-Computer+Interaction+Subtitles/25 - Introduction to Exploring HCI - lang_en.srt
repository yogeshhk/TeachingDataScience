[MUSIC]

2
00:00:05,745 --> 00:00:09,145
[SOUND] Computers are finding their
way into more and more devices, and

3
00:00:09,145 --> 00:00:11,750
as a result HCI is becoming more and
more ubiquitous.

4
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:14,399
It used to be that you wouldn't
really need to think too

5
00:00:14,399 --> 00:00:18,143
much about HCI when designing a car or
designing a refrigerator, but more and

6
00:00:18,143 --> 00:00:21,030
more computing is pervading everything.

7
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:22,150
At the same time,

8
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:25,510
new technological developments are
opening up new areas for exploration.

9
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:29,400
We're seeing a lot of really fascinating
progress in areas like virtual reality,

10
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,920
augmented reality, wearable devices.

11
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,400
As we study HCI, we're going to talk
a lot about things you've already used

12
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:36,930
like computers and phones.

13
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:39,790
But we want you to keep in mind some
of these more cutting edge application

14
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:41,210
areas as well.

15
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:44,600
After all, if you're really interested
in going into HCI professionally,

16
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,445
you'll be designing for
these new application areas.

17
00:00:46,445 --> 00:00:49,585
So we're going to quickly
preview some of these.

18
00:00:49,585 --> 00:00:53,975
We'll divide them into three areas,
technologies, domains and ideas.

19
00:00:53,975 --> 00:00:57,555
Technologies are emerging technological
capabilities that let us create new and

20
00:00:57,555 --> 00:00:59,013
interesting user interactions.

21
00:00:59,013 --> 00:01:02,935
Domains are pre-existing areas that
could be significantly disrupted

22
00:01:02,935 --> 00:01:05,940
by computer interfaces like
healthcare and education.

23
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:07,400
Ideas span both of these.

24
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:10,230
They are the theories about the way
people interact with interfaces and

25
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:11,660
the world around them.

26
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:13,690
Now, our delineation of
this is kind of artificial.

27
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:15,070
There's a lot of overlap.

28
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:17,810
New technologies like augmented
reality are what allow emerging

29
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:22,100
ideas like contact sensitive computing
to really have the power that they do.

30
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:23,020
But for organization,

31
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:26,270
we'll group our application areas
into these three categories.

32
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:29,350
When one of these areas catches
your eye, take a little while and

33
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:31,040
delve into it a little bit deeper.

34
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,990
Then keep that topic area in mind as you
go through the rest of the HCI material.

35
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:37,230
We'll revisit your chosen area
throughout the course, and

36
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:39,960
ask you to reflect on the application
of the course's principals and

37
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,830
methods to your application area.
