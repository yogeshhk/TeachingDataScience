1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,940
So when should you consider using
these more agile methodologies?

2
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:06,598
Lots of software development
theorists have explored this space.

3
00:00:06,598 --> 00:00:09,730
Boehm and Turner specifically
suggest that agile development

4
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:12,100
can only be used in
certain circumstances.

5
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:15,540
First, they say, it must be
an environment with low criticality.

6
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:16,540
By it's nature,

7
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:19,290
agile development means letting
the users do some of the testing.

8
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:21,590
So you don't want to use it
in environments where bugs or

9
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:24,740
poor usability are going to
lead to major repercussions.

10
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:27,390
Healthcare or financial investing
wouldn't be great places for

11
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:28,960
agile development, generally speaking.

12
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,780
Although there have been efforts to
create standards that would allow

13
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:35,970
the methodology to apply, without
compromising security and safety.

14
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:38,530
But for things like smartphone games and
social media apps,

15
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:40,780
the criticality is sufficiently low.

16
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:44,040
Second, it should really be a place
where requirements change often.

17
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:47,070
One of the benefits of an agile
process is they allow teams to adjust

18
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:49,700
quickly to changing expectations or
needs.

19
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:53,270
A thermostat, for example, doesn't
change it's requirements very often.

20
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:54,880
A site like Udacity though,

21
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:58,610
is constantly adjusting to new
student interests or student needs.

22
00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:02,490
Now these two components apply to
the types of problems we're working on.

23
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:05,250
If we're working on an interface that
would lend itself to a more agile

24
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:10,010
process, we also must set up the team
to work well within an agile process.

25
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:13,330
That means small teams that
are comfortable with change.

26
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:16,530
As opposed to large teams
that thrive on order.

27
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:19,900
So generally, agile processes
can be good in some cases

28
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:22,300
with the right people,
but poor in many others.
