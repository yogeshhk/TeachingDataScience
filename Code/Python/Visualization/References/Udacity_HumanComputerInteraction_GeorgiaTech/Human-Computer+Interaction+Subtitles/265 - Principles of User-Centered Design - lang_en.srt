00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,280
The International Standards Organization has outlined

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:05,520
six principles to follow when pursuing user-centered design.

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,070
Number one, the design is based on

4
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:11,940
explicit understanding of users, tasks, and environments.

5
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:14,430
That means we must gather information about the users,

6
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:17,085
the task they performed, and where they perform those tasks.

7
00:00:17,085 --> 00:00:20,400
We need to leverage that knowledge throughout the design process.

8
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,475
Number two, users are involved throughout design and development.

9
00:00:24,475 --> 00:00:26,870
Involvement can take on many forms from

10
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:29,090
regularly participating with interviews and surveys about

11
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:33,725
our designs to actually working on the design team alongside the designers themselves.

12
00:00:33,725 --> 00:00:38,765
Number three, the design is driven and refined by user-centered evaluation.

13
00:00:38,765 --> 00:00:40,880
We absolutely must have real users

14
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:43,865
evaluating the prototypes and interfaces that we assemble.

15
00:00:43,865 --> 00:00:46,880
Number four, the process is iterative.

16
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,455
No tool is developed once,

17
00:00:48,455 --> 00:00:49,865
released, and then abandoned.

18
00:00:49,865 --> 00:00:54,500
Designs undergo constant iteration and improvement even after being released.

19
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:58,970
Number five, the design addresses the whole user experience.

20
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:01,460
Many designers are tempted to delineate a certain portion

21
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:03,710
of the experience as their primary interest,

22
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:06,625
but we must address the entire user experience.

23
00:01:06,625 --> 00:01:11,580
Number six, the design team includes multidisciplinary skills and perspectives.

24
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:14,090
Good teams for pursuing user-centered design include

25
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:16,700
people with a number of different backgrounds like psychologists,

26
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:19,460
designers, computer scientists, domain experts, and more.

27
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:23,630
So, keep these principles in mind when you're doing user experience design.
