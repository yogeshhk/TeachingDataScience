1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:02,850
First, in terms of
the gulf of execution,

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:06,100
the insertion method is actually
physically easier to do.

3
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:08,880
While you can be both too fast and
too slow with the sliding method,

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,130
you can't push it too far in
with the insertion method.

5
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:12,730
So you know if there's an error,

6
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:15,280
it's because the card isn't
far enough into the reader.

7
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,390
And second, there's rich feedback
with the insertion method.

8
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:19,780
It doesn't even have to come from
the screen telling you that you didn't

9
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:20,870
do it correctly.

10
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:23,346
You feel the card stop when it's
far enough into the reader.

11
00:00:23,346 --> 00:00:26,586
You have immediate physical feedback on
whether you're putting it in the right

12
00:00:26,586 --> 00:00:29,824
place, and whether you've actually put
it far enough in, rather than delayed

13
00:00:29,824 --> 00:00:32,600
feedback asking you to try again
after some kind of waiting period.
