00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:06,450
The idea of artifacts or interfaces having

2
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:10,470
political clout brings up two challenges for us as interface designers.

3
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:13,140
First, we need to think about places where we can use

4
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:16,320
interface design to invoke positive social change,

5
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,510
and second, we also need to think about

6
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:21,630
the possible negative ramifications of our interfaces.

7
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:24,285
What undesirable stereotypes are we preserving

8
00:00:24,285 --> 00:00:27,270
or what new negative dynamics might we create?

9
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:32,145
Now, obviously I work in online education and I've been struck by both sides of this.

10
00:00:32,145 --> 00:00:34,940
On the positive side, I've been amazed at the power of

11
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:36,740
online education to diminish

12
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:40,309
the significance of superficial obstacles to people's success.

13
00:00:40,309 --> 00:00:43,730
I've spoken with people who have had difficulty succeeding in

14
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:48,215
traditional college settings due to social anxiety disorders or other disabilities,

15
00:00:48,215 --> 00:00:51,560
things that had no real connection to how well they understood the material,

16
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:53,000
but that made it difficult to interact with

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,690
other people or to attend to physical classes.

18
00:00:55,690 --> 00:00:59,705
But by putting everything in forums and emails and text and videos,

19
00:00:59,705 --> 00:01:02,000
they've been able to overcome those obstacles.

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,610
But there's also the risk that online education

21
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:07,520
will only benefit people who already have advantages.

22
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:11,510
The early data suggests that the majority of consumers of online education are

23
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:14,015
middle-class American white males

24
00:01:14,015 --> 00:01:16,580
There's little data to suggest that it's reaching minorities,

25
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:18,590
reaching women, reaching international students

26
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:21,080
or reaching economically disadvantaged students,

27
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:24,050
and while I believe that's a problem that can be solved,

28
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:26,120
it's certainly something we need to address.

29
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:31,000
Otherwise, we risk online education being a luxury more than an equalizer.

30
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,770
So, that's how these principles relate to online education.

31
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:38,575
Take a moment and reflect on how they apply to the area of HCI that you chose to explore.

32
00:01:38,575 --> 00:01:41,210
What role can your technology play in creating

33
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:46,730
positive societal change and what risks are there if your technology catches on?
