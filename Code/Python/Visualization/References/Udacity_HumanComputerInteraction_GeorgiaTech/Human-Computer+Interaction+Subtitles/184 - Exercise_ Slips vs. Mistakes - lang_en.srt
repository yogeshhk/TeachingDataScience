When you're looking to
improve an interface,

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:04,830
user errors are powerful
places to start.

3
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:07,830
They're indicative either of weaknesses
in the user's mental model or

4
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:11,600
places where the system isn't capturing
the user's correct mental model.

5
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:14,590
So let's try to address
an error Morgan's encountering.

6
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:16,300
Morgan usually texts
with her boyfriend but

7
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:18,120
she texts with some other people too.

8
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:21,600
But she finds she's often sending
the wrong messages to the wrong people.

9
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,560
The app by default brings up
the last open conversation and

10
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,110
usually that's her boyfriend.

11
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:29,620
But sometimes it's someone else and
she accidentally messages them instead.

12
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:31,910
First, is this a slip or
is this a mistake?
