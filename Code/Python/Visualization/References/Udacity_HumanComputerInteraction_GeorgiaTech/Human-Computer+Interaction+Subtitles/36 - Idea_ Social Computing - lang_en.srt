00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,270
Social computing is the portion of HCI that's interested

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:06,780
in how computers affect the way we interact and socialize.

3
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:08,460
One thing that falls under this umbrella,

4
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:13,095
is the idea of re-creating social norms within computational systems.

5
00:00:13,095 --> 00:00:14,970
So, for example, when you chat online,

6
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:17,234
you might often use emojis or emoticons.

7
00:00:17,234 --> 00:00:19,260
Those are virtual re-creations of some of

8
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:22,350
the tacit interaction we have with each other on a day-to-day basis.

9
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:27,240
So, for example, these all take on different meanings depending on the emotion provided.

10
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:30,810
Social computing is interested in a lot more than just emojis, of course,

11
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:34,740
from online gaming and Wikipedia to social media to dating websites.

12
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:37,200
Social computing is really interested in all areas,

13
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,450
where computing intersects with our social lives.
