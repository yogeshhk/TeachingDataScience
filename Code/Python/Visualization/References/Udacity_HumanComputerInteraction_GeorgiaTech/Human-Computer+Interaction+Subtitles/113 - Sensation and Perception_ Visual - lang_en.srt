1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,430
Let's start by talking a bit about
what the average person can sense and

2
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:04,330
perceive.

3
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:06,100
So, here we have Morgan again.

4
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:07,710
Morgan has eyes.

5
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:10,080
Morgan's eyes are useful for
a lot of things.

6
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,790
The center of Morgan's eye is most
useful for focusing closely on color or

7
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:15,490
tracking movement.

8
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:18,020
So, we can assume that the most
important details should be placed in

9
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:19,650
the center of her view.

10
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:22,790
Morgan's peripheral vision is good for
detecting motion, but

11
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:25,183
it isn't as good for
detecting color or detail.

12
00:00:25,183 --> 00:00:27,477
So while we might use her periphery for
some alerts,

13
00:00:27,477 --> 00:00:30,920
we shouldn't require her to focus
closely on anything out there.

14
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:33,240
As a woman,
Morgan is unlikely to be colorblind,

15
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:35,770
she has about a 1 in 200 chance.

16
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:39,800
Men have a much greater prevalence
of color blindness at about 1 in 12.

17
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:42,130
Either way,
that's a significant body of people.

18
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:45,117
So we want to avoid relying on
color to understand the interface.

19
00:00:45,117 --> 00:00:48,847
We can use it to emphasize knowledge
that it's already present in the system,

20
00:00:48,847 --> 00:00:52,290
but using the system shouldn't
rely on perceiving color.

21
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:53,992
Sight is directional.

22
00:00:53,992 --> 00:00:56,180
If Morgan's looking the wrong way or
has her eyes closed,

23
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:57,360
she'll miss visual feedback.

24
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:02,120
As Morgan gets older,
her visual acuity will decrease.

25
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:04,569
So if we're designing something
with older audiences in mind,

26
00:01:04,569 --> 00:01:07,130
we want to be careful of
things like font size.

27
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:10,980
Ideally, these would be adjustable to
meet the needs of multiple audiences.

28
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:12,220
All together though,

29
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:15,620
Morgan's visual system is hugely
important to her cognition.

30
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:19,306
The majority of concepts we cover in
HCI are likely connected to visual

31
00:01:19,306 --> 00:01:20,063
perception.

32
00:01:20,063 --> 00:01:20,563
