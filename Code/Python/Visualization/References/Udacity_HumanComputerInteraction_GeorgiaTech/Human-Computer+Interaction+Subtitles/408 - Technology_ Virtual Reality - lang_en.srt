1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,150
The year that I'm recording this is what many have described as;

2
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:06,075
the year that virtual reality finally hits the mainstream.

3
00:00:06,075 --> 00:00:07,380
By the time you watch this,

4
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:09,750
you'll probably be able to assess whether or not that was true,

5
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:12,000
so come back in time and let me know.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,270
Virtual reality is an entire new classification of interaction and

7
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:17,340
visualization and we're definitely still at

8
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:20,325
the beginning of figuring out what we can do with these new tools.

9
00:00:20,325 --> 00:00:23,040
You could be one of the ones who figures out the best way to resolve

10
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:27,210
motion sickness or how to give proper feedback on gestural interactions.

11
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:29,820
A lot of the press around virtual reality has been around

12
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:32,760
video games but that's definitely not the only application.

13
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:35,400
Tourism, commerce, art, education,

14
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:38,510
virtual reality has applications to dozens of spaces.

15
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:42,520
For example, there's a lab in Michigan that's using virtual reality to treat phobias.

16
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:44,420
They're creating a safe space where people can

17
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:47,740
very authentically and realistically confront their fears.

18
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:50,880
The possible applications of virtual reality are really staggering,

19
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:53,970
so I'd encourage you to check them out as you go through this class.
