1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,370
We'll close by talking about the overall
structure of the content you'll be

2
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:04,570
consuming.

3
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:07,620
The course's lessons are designed to
be as independent as possible, so

4
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:09,080
you should be able to
skip around if you want,

5
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:12,870
but there's a certain logic to
our planned presentation order.

6
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:16,149
We discussed earlier the model HCI,
how design informs research and

7
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:18,010
research then informs design, so

8
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:21,830
we'll start by discussing some of
the core design principles of HCI.

9
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:23,690
Then we'll discuss
the research methodologies for

10
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:27,280
uncovering new user information,
the interative design lifecycle.

11
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:30,282
We'll close by giving you the
opportunity to peek at what's going on

12
00:00:30,282 --> 00:00:31,640
in the HCI community at large.
