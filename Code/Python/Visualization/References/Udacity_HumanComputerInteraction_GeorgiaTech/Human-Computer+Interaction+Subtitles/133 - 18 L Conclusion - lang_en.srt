00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:07,830
Today we've gone through a crash course on human abilities and perception.

2
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:10,350
We started off by talking about the main ways people

3
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:13,725
perceive the world around them through sight, sound, and touch.

4
00:00:13,725 --> 00:00:18,690
Then we discussed some of the components of cognition especially memory, and learning.

5
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:20,400
Then we discussed the motor system,

6
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,055
how the person then interacts with the world around them.

7
00:00:23,055 --> 00:00:27,015
In this single lesson, we've only scratched the surface of human perception.

8
00:00:27,015 --> 00:00:28,560
There are entire courses,

9
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,730
even entire degree programs that focus on these principles.

10
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:33,560
We'll give you some suggestions on some in the notes.

11
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:36,440
So, don't think we've given you a full view of the field.

12
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:40,460
Instead, we hope we've given you just enough to start to keep human abilities in mind,

13
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:44,290
and enough to know what to research as you start to learn to design interfaces.
