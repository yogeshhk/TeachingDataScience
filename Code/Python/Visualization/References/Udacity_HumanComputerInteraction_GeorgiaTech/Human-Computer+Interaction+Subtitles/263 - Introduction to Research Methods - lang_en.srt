1
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:07,815
When you start to design a new interface,

2
00:00:07,815 --> 00:00:09,870
your goal is to design an interface that will meet

3
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:12,405
the needs of the user better than the existing design.

4
00:00:12,405 --> 00:00:16,570
It's very rare that we design for tasks that users have never even performed before.

5
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:20,490
We're almost always developing new ways to accomplish old tasks.

6
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:24,330
Facebook, for example, was a new way to socialize and communicate with others,

7
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:28,020
but the fundamental activities of socializing and communicating weren't new.

8
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:29,840
Facebook just met those needs better or,

9
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:32,530
at least, met certain needs better depending on who you ask.

10
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:35,840
In order to design interactions that are better than existing designs,

11
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,530
it's important to take into consideration

12
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:40,545
the user's needs at every stage of the design process.

13
00:00:40,545 --> 00:00:42,980
That's what this unit of this course will cover.

14
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:44,450
We don't generally want to build

15
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:47,810
creative novel interfaces just for the sake of creativity or novelty.

16
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:51,030
We want novelty to have a purpose and to achieve that purpose,

17
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:54,310
it must be used with a strong understanding of the user's task.

18
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:57,860
So, in this unit, we'll cover the design life cycle as well as methods for gathering

19
00:00:57,860 --> 00:01:01,685
feedback and information from users at every stage of the cycle.

20
00:01:01,685 --> 00:01:04,145
However, before we get started on that,

21
00:01:04,145 --> 00:01:07,430
we need to set up some basic concepts we use throughout our discussions.

22
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:10,010
We'll start by discussing user-centered design and then

23
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:12,680
we'll introduce the four-stage design life cycle.

24
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:16,055
We'll discuss a few different general methods for pursuing the design life cycle.

25
00:01:16,055 --> 00:01:18,680
Then finally, we will discuss the two kinds of information or

26
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:21,750
data that we gather, qualitative and quantitative.
