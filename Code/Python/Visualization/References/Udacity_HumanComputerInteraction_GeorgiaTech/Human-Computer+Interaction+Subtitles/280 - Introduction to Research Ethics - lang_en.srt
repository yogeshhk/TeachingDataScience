2
00:00:06,029 --> 00:00:09,395
Before we start working with real users
there are a few ethical considerations

3
00:00:09,395 --> 00:00:10,730
we have to make.

4
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:13,680
If you are doing a research as part of
a university these are part of your

5
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:17,000
contract with the university to
do research on their behalf.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,770
Even if you are doing
research independently for

7
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:22,470
an industry there are still
ethical obligations to follow.

8
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:25,060
These considerations are important not
only to preserve the rights of our

9
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:28,890
users, but also to ensure the value
of the data that we gather.

10
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:31,670
In this lesson, we'll talk a little
bit about where these kinds of ethical

11
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:33,550
considerations came from.

12
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:34,390
Then we'll talk about some of

13
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:37,100
the basic ethical considerations
that we need to make.

14
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:39,460
We'll also talk about
Institutional Review Board, or IRB,

15
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:43,140
the university organization that
governs human subjects research.
