1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:02,870
The brainstorming process
should lead you to a list of

2
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:05,810
bunch of high level general
design alternatives.

3
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:08,620
These are likely just a few words or
a sentence each but

4
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:12,460
they described some very general idea
of how you might design the interface,

5
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:14,540
to accomplish this task.

6
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:17,580
Your next step is to try to flush
these ideas out into three or

7
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:21,720
four ideas that are worth taking
forward to the prototyping stage.

8
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:24,000
Some of the ideas you might be
able to dismiss pretty quickly,

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,100
that's all right.

10
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:28,520
You can't generate good ideas
without generating a lot of ideas.

11
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:30,970
Even though you won't end
up using all of them.

12
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:34,420
In other places, you might explore
an idea a little before dismissing it or

13
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:37,720
you might combine two
ideas into a new idea.

14
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:38,960
In the rest of this lesson,

15
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,330
we'll give you some thought experiments
you can use to evaluate these ideas and

16
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:45,570
decide what to keep,
what to combine and what to dismiss.
