00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:08,245
This wraps up our conversation on research methods and the Design Life Cycle.

2
00:00:08,245 --> 00:00:11,070
The purpose of this is to put a strong focus on

3
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:14,320
user-centered design throughout the process.

4
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,710
We want to start our designs by understanding

5
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:20,610
user needs and then get user feedback throughout the design process.

6
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:23,490
As we do, our understanding of the user and

7
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:27,630
the task improves and our designs improve along with it.

8
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:30,000
Even after we've released our designs,

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,990
modern technology allows us to continue that feedback cycle continually

10
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:38,270
improving our interfaces and further enhancing the user experience.
