# Starter (Default) Bot

The `starter` example is designed to help you see and run the out-of-the-box working chatbot.

## How to get the Starter example?

```
pip install rasa

python -W ignore -m rasa init --no-prompt
```

The rasa init command creates all the files that a Rasa project needs and trains a simple bot on some sample data. If you leave out the --no-prompt flag you will be asked some questions about how you want your project to be set up.

## What’s inside this example?

This example contains some training data and the main files needed to build an
assistant on your local machine. The `formbot` consists of the following files:

- **data/nlu.md** contains training examples for the NLU model  
- **data/stories.md** contains training stories for the Core model
- **config.yml** contains the model configuration
- **domain.yml** contains the domain of the assistant  

## How to use this example?

- Train a Rasa model containing the Rasa NLU and Rasa Core models by running:
    ```
    python -W ignore -m rasa train
    ```
    The model will be stored in the `/models` directory as a zipped file.

- In another window:
    ```
	python -W ignore -m rasa shell --quiet --cors * -m models 
    ```
    This will load the assistant in your command line for you to chat.
