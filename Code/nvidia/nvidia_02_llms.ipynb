    "### **Learning Objectives:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understanding the pros and cons of running LLM services locally vs in a scalable cloud environment.\n",
    "- Getting familiar with the AI Foundation Model Endpoint schemes, including:\n",
    "    - The raw low-level connection interface facilitated by packages like `curl` and `requests`\n",
    "    - The abstractions created to make this interface function seamlessly with open-sourced software like LangChain.\n",

    "### **Questions To Think About:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What kind of model access should you give a person developing an LLM stack, and how does it compare to the access you need to provide to end-users of an AI-powered web application?\n",
    "2. When considering which devices to support, what kinds of rigid assumptions are you making about their local compute resources and what types of fallbacks should you implement?\n",
    "    - What if you wanted to deliver a jupyter labs interface with access to a private LLM deployment to customers.\n",
    "    - What if now you wanted to support their local jupyter lab environment with your private LLM deployment?\n",
    "    - Would anything have to change if you decided to support embedded devices (i.e. Jetson Nano)?\n",
    "3. **[Harder]** Assume you have Stable Diffusion, Mixtral, and Llama-13B deployed on your own compute instance in a cloud environment sharing the same GPU resource. You currently do not have a business use case for Stable Diffusion, but your teams are experimenting with the other two for LLM applications. Should you remove Stable Diffusion from your deployment?\n",

    "## **Part 1**: Getting Large Models Into Your Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall from the last notebook that our current environment has several microservices running on an allocated cloud instance: `jupyter-notebook-server`, `frontend`, and `milvus` (among others). We briefly discussed these, and you may have noticed that there an \"LLM Service\" was never mentioned despite the course's emphasis on LLMs for retrieval...\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course, we'll be introducing you to the [**NVIDIA AI Foundation Models and Endpoints service**](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/ai-foundation-models) to use it as a legitimate prototyping LLM service with a natural path towards self-hosted large model deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$---$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Across just about every domain, deploying massive deep learning models is a common yet challenging task. Today's models, such as Llama 2 (70B parameters) or ensemble models like Mixtral 7x8B, are products of advanced training methods, vast data resources, and powerful computing systems. Luckily for us, these models have already been trained and many use cases can already be achieved with off-the-shelf solutions. The real hurdle, however, lies in effectively hosting these models.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Deployment Scenarios for Large Models:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **High-End Datacenter Deployment:**\n",
    "> An uncompressed, unquantized model on a data center stack equipped with GPUs like NVIDIA's [A100](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/a100/) or [H100](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/a100/) to facilitate fast inference and experimentation.\n",
    "> - **Pros**: Ideal for scalable deployment and experimentation, this stack is ideal for either large training workflows or for supporting multiple users or models at the same time.  \n",
    "> - **Cons:** It is inefficient to allocate this resource for each user of your service unless the use cases involve model training/fine-tuning or interfacing with lower-level model components.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Modest Datacenter/Specialized Consumer Hardware Deployment:**\n",
    "> Quantized and further-optimized models can be run (one or two per instance) on more conservative datacenter GPUs such as [L40](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/l40/)/[A30](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/products/a30-gpu/)/[A10](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/products/a10-gpu/) or even on some modern consumer GPUs such as the higher-VRAM [RTX 40-series GPUs](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/graphics-cards/40-series/).\n",
    "> - **Pros:** This setup balances inference speed with manageable limitations for single-user applications. These sessions can also be deployed on a per-user basis to run one or two large models at a time with raw access to model internals (even if they need quantization).\n",
    "> - **Cons:** Deploying an instance for each user is still costly at scale, though it may be justifiable for some niche workloads. Alternatively, assuming that users can access these resources in their local environments is likely unreasonable.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Consumer Hardware Deployment:**\n",
    "> Though heavily limited in ability to propagate data through a neural network, most consumer hardware does have a graphical user interface (GUI), a web browser with internet access, some amount of memory (can safely assume at least 1 GB), and a decently-powerful CPU.\n",
    "> - **Cons:** Most hardware at the moment cannot run more than one local large model at a time in any configuration, and running even one model will require significant amounts of resource management and optimizing restrictions.\n",
    "> - **Pros:** This is a reasonable and inclusive starting assumption when considering what kinds of users your services should support.\n"

    "\n",
    "**Black-Box Hosted Models:**\n",
    "> Services such as [**OpenAI**](https://openai.com/) offer APIs to interact with black-box models like GPT-4. These powerful, well-integrated services can provide simple interfaces to complex pipelines that automatically track memory, call additional models, and incorporate multimodal interfaces as necessary to simplify typical use scenarios. At the same time, they maintain operational opacity and often lack a straightforward path to self-hosting.\n",
    "> - **Pros:** Easy to use out-of-the-box with shallow barriers to entry for an average user.\n",
    "> - **Cons:** Black-box deployments suffer from potential privacy concerns, limited customization, and cost implications at scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Self-Hosted Models:**\n",
    "\n",
    "> Behind the scenes of just about all scaled model deployments is one or more giant models running in a data center with scalable resources and lightning-fast bandwidth at their disposal. Though necessary to deploy large models at scale and maintain strong control over the provided interfaces, these systems often require expertise to set up and generally do not work well for supporting non-developer workflows for only one individual at a time. Such systems are much better for supporting many simultaneous users, multiple models, and custom interfaces.\n",
    "> - **Pros:** They offer the capability to integrate custom datasets and APIs and are primarily designed to support numerous users concurrently.\n",
    "> - **Cons:** These setups demand technical expertise to set up and are not as practical for an individual non-developer user.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get the best of both worlds, we will utilize the [**NVIDIA NGC Service**](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/gpu-cloud/). NGC offers a suite of developer tools for designing and deploying AI solutions. Central to our needs are the [NVIDIA AI Foundation Models](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-data-science/foundation-models/), which are pre-tuned and pre-optimized models designed for easy out-of-the-box scalable deployment (as-is or with further customization). Furthermore, NGC hosts accessible model endpoints for querying live foundation models in a [scalable DGX-accelerated compute environment](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/dgx-platform/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, NGC endpoints offers a slew of complementary queries, as few as 10,000 for the largest models and much more for the smaller models. This generous quota makes NGC an ideal, virtually free resource for prototyping production-oriented systems and experimenting with new models."

    "This may be unexpected if you're more used to raw LLM interfaces like those of local HuggingFace models, but it will look pretty standard to users of OpenAI models. By enforcing a restricted interface instead of a raw text completion one, the service can have more control over what the users can do. There are plenty of pros and cons to this interface, with some noteworthy ones below:\n",
    "- A service might restrict the use of a specific role type or parameter (i.e. system message restriction, priming message to get arbitrary generation, etc).\n",
    "- A service might enforce custom prompt formats and implement extra options under the hood that rely on the chat interface.\n",
    "- A service might use stronger assumptions to implement deeper optimizations in the inference pipeline.\n",
    "- A service might mimic another popular interface to leverage existing ecosystem compatibilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of these are valid reasons, and it's important to consider which interface options are best for your particular use cases when choosing or deploying your own service."

In this case, the response body will look a lot more like this:\n",

Whether your goal environment is a Jupyter environment, a node backend, or an embedded edge device, the core commands will be sufficient to construct an interface to make the service work from just about any network-accessible device – given enough time and effort. With that said, we'll need to make some connectors if we want our service to work with other frameworks.\n",

In this course, we'll want to take advantage of LangChain's thriving chain-centric ecosystem, but the raw `requests` API will not take us all the way there. Under the hood, every LangChain chat model that isn't hosted locally has to rely on such an API, but the developer-facing API is a much cleaner [`LLM` or `SimpleChatModel`-style interface](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/model_io/) with default parameters and some simple utility functions like `generate` and `stream`. Unfortunately, creating such a connector is well out of scope for this course and requires a decent amount of effort to get right. ***Luckily for us, it already exists!***"
