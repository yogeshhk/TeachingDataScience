    "In the previous notebook, we learned about embedding models and exercised some of their capabilities. We discussed their intended use cases of longer-form document comparison and found ways to use it as a backbone for more custom semantic comparisons. This notebook will progress these ideas toward the retrieval model's intended use case and explore how to build chatbot systems that rely on *vector stores* to automatically save and retrieve information.\n",

    "### **Learning Objectives:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand how semantic-similarity-backed systems can facilitate easy-to-use retrieval formulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Learn how to incorporate retrieval modules into your chat model systems for a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline, which can be applied to tasks like document retrieval and conversation memory buffers.\n",
