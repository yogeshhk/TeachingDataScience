__label__1	Wow... Loved this place.
__label__0	Crust is not good.
__label__0	Not tasty and the texture was just nasty.
__label__1	Stopped by during the late May bank holiday off Rick Steve recommendation and loved it.
__label__1	The selection on the menu was great and so were the prices.
__label__0	Now I am getting angry and I want my damn pho.
__label__0	Honeslty it didn't taste THAT fresh.)
__label__0	The potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer.
__label__1	The fries were great too.
__label__1	A great touch.
__label__1	Service was very prompt.
__label__0	Would not go back.
__label__0	The cashier had no care what so ever on what I had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced.
__label__1	"I tried the Cape Cod ravoli, chicken, with cranberry...mmmm!"
__label__0	I was disgusted because I was pretty sure that was human hair.
__label__0	I was shocked because no signs indicate cash only.
__label__1	Highly recommended.
__label__0	Waitress was a little slow in service.
__label__0	"This place is not worth your time, let alone Vegas."
__label__0	did not like at all.
__label__0	The Burrittos Blah!
__label__1	"The food, amazing."
__label__1	Service is also cute.
__label__1	I could care less... The interior is just beautiful.
__label__1	So they performed.
__label__1	That's right....the red velvet cake.....ohhh this stuff is so good.
__label__0	#NAME?
__label__1	"This hole in the wall has great Mexican street tacos, and friendly staff."
__label__0	"Took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was Luke warm, Our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed."
__label__0	The worst was the salmon sashimi.
__label__1	"Also there are combos like a burger, fries, and beer for 23 which is a decent deal."
__label__0	This was like the final blow!
__label__1	I found this place by accident and I could not be happier.
__label__0	"seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food, but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere."
__label__1	"Overall, I like this place a lot."
__label__1	The only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive.
__label__1	Ample portions and good prices.
__label__0	"Poor service, the waiter made me feel like I was stupid every time he came to the table."
__label__1	My first visit to Hiro was a delight!
__label__0	Service sucks.
__label__1	The shrimp tender and moist.
__label__0	There is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again.
__label__0	Hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didn't want to eat it for fear of getting sick.
__label__1	"On a positive note, our server was very attentive and provided great service."
__label__0	"Frozen pucks of disgust, with some of the worst people behind the register."
__label__1	The only thing I did like was the prime rib and dessert section.
__label__0	It's too bad the food is so damn generic.
__label__1	"The burger is good beef, cooked just right."
__label__1	If you want a sandwich just go to any Firehouse!!!!!
__label__1	"My side Greek salad with the Greek dressing was so tasty, and the pita and hummus was very refreshing."
__label__1	We ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside.
__label__1	He came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table.
__label__1	Their chow mein is so good!
__label__0	"They have horrible attitudes towards customers, and talk down to each one when customers don't enjoy their food."
__label__1	The portion was huge!
__label__1	"Loved it...friendly servers, great food, wonderful and imaginative menu."
__label__0	The Heart Attack Grill in downtown Vegas is an absolutely flat-lined excuse for a restaurant.
__label__0	Not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom.
__label__1	"The salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop, which was perfectly cooked."
__label__0	"The ripped banana was not only ripped, but petrified and tasteless."
__label__0	At least think to refill my water before I struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes.
__label__1	This place receives stars for their APPETIZERS!!!
__label__1	The cocktails are all handmade and delicious.
__label__1	We'd definitely go back here again.
__label__1	We are so glad we found this place.
__label__1	"Great food and service, huge portions and they give a military discount."
__label__1	Always a great time at Dos Gringos!
__label__1	Update.....went back for a second time and it was still just as amazing
__label__0	We got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy.
__label__1	A great way to finish a great.
__label__1	"The deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks, and Jeff went above and beyond what we expected."
__label__1	#NAME?
__label__0	The service was meh.
__label__0	"It took over 30 min to get their milkshake, which was nothing more than chocolate milk."
__label__0	"I guess I should have known that this place would suck, because it is inside of the Excalibur, but I didn't use my common sense."
__label__0	The scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well.
__label__0	2 times - Very Bad Customer Service !
__label__1	The sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well.
__label__1	Today is the second time I've been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good.
__label__0	There is so much good food in Vegas that I feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to Rice and Company.
__label__0	Coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties can't wait for the other person to ask to break up.
__label__0	walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating.
__label__0	The turkey and roast beef were bland.
__label__1	This place has it!
__label__0	The pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old.
__label__1	I love the Pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try.
__label__0	The poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying.
__label__1	All I have to say is the food was amazing!!!
__label__1	Omelets are to die for!
__label__1	Everything was fresh and delicious!
__label__0	"In summary, this was a largely disappointing dining experience."
__label__1	"It's like a really sexy party in your mouth, where you're outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party."
__label__0	"Never been to Hard Rock Casino before, WILL NEVER EVER STEP FORWARD IN IT AGAIN!"
__label__1	Best breakfast buffet!!!
__label__0	say bye bye to your tip lady!
__label__0	We'll never go again.
__label__1	Will be back again!
__label__1	Food arrived quickly!
__label__0	It was not good.
__label__1	"On the up side, their cafe serves really good food."
__label__1	"Our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow, he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go!"
__label__1	"The only good thing was our waiter, he was very helpful and kept the bloddy mary's coming."
__label__1	"Best Buffet in town, for the price you cannot beat it."
__label__1	"I LOVED their mussels cooked in this wine reduction, the duck was tender, and their potato dishes were delicious."
__label__1	This is one of the better buffets that I have been to.
__label__1	So we went to Tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon!
__label__1	"The food was delicious, our bartender was attentive and personable AND we got a great deal!"
__label__1	The ambience is wonderful and there is music playing.
__label__1	Will go back next trip out.
__label__1	Sooooo good!!
__label__0	"REAL sushi lovers, let's be honest - Yama is not that good."
__label__0	"At least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving, and it wasn't that busy."
__label__1	This is a really fantastic Thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit.
__label__1	"Nice, spicy and tender."
__label__1	Good prices.
__label__1	Check it out.
__label__0	It was pretty gross!
__label__0	I've had better atmosphere.
__label__0	Kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did.
__label__0	"Although I very much liked the look and sound of this place, the actual experience was a bit disappointing."
__label__0	I just don't know how this place managed to served the blandest food I have ever eaten when they are preparing Indian cuisine.
__label__0	"Worst service to boot, but that is the least of their worries."
__label__1	Service was fine and the waitress was friendly.
__label__1	"The guys all had steaks, and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak he's ever eaten."
__label__1	"We thought you'd have to venture further away to get good sushi, but this place really hit the spot that night."
__label__0	"Host staff were, for lack of a better word, BITCHES!"
__label__0	Bland... Not a liking this place for a number of reasons and I don't want to waste time on bad reviewing.. I'll leave it at that...
__label__1	"Phenomenal food, service and ambiance."
__label__0	I wouldn't return.
__label__1	"Definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly, will return next time I'm in Vegas."
__label__0	This place is way too overpriced for mediocre food.
__label__1	Penne vodka excellent!
__label__1	"They have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich, a crispy chicken wrap, a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers."
__label__0	The management is rude.
__label__1	"Delicious NYC bagels, good selections of cream cheese, real Lox with capers even."
__label__1	"Great Subway, in fact it's so good when you come here every other Subway will not meet your expectations."
__label__1	I had a seriously solid breakfast here.
__label__1	This is one of the best bars with food in Vegas.
__label__0	"He was extremely rude and really, there are so many other restaurants I would love to dine at during a weekend in Vegas."
__label__1	My drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions.
__label__0	Don't do it!!!!
__label__0	The waiter wasn't helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us.
__label__0	My husband and I ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service.
__label__0	And the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasn't very tasty to me.
__label__1	Nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food.
__label__1	The bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated.
__label__0	"The menu is always changing, food quality is going down & service is extremely slow."
__label__0	"The service was a little slow , considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace."
__label__0	I give it 2 thumbs down
__label__0	We watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us.
__label__1	My fiancé and I came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away.
__label__1	This is a great restaurant at the Mandalay Bay.
__label__0	We waited for forty five minutes in vain.
__label__0	Crostini that came with the salad was stale.
__label__1	Some highlights : Great quality nigiri here!
__label__1	the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean.
__label__1	this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored.
__label__1	I ordered the Voodoo pasta and it was the first time I'd had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago.
__label__1	this place is good.
__label__0	"Unfortunately, we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was STALE."
__label__0	I came back today since they relocated and still not impressed.
__label__1	I was seated immediately.
__label__1	"Their menu is diverse, and reasonably priced."
__label__0	Avoid at all cost!
__label__1	Restaurant is always full but never a wait.
__label__1	DELICIOUS!!
__label__1	This place is hands-down one of the best places to eat in the Phoenix metro area.
__label__0	So don't go there if you are looking for good food...
__label__0	I've never been treated so bad.
__label__1	Bacon is hella salty.
__label__0	"We also ordered the spinach and avocado salad, the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste."
__label__1	"This really is how Vegas fine dining used to be, right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed."
__label__1	The waitresses are very friendly.
__label__1	"Lordy, the Khao Soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers!"
__label__1	Everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter.
__label__0	"Perhaps I caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews, but I'm not inspired to go back."
__label__0	The service here leaves a lot to be desired.
__label__1	"The atmosphere is modern and hip, while maintaining a touch of coziness."
__label__1	"Not a weekly haunt, but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while."
__label__0	We literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order.
__label__0	"The burger had absolutely no flavor - the meat itself was totally bland, the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor."
__label__0	I also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack.
__label__0	I dressed up to be treated so rudely!
__label__0	It was probably dirt.
__label__1	"Love this place, hits the spot when I want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor."
__label__1	I ordered the Lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible.
__label__0	"The food sucked, which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined."
__label__1	Interesting decor.
__label__1	What I really like there is the crepe station.
__label__1	"Also were served hot bread and butter, and home made potato chips with bacon bits on top....very original and very good."
__label__1	you can watch them preparing the delicious food!)
__label__1	Both of the egg rolls were fantastic.
__label__0	"When my order arrived, one of the gyros was missing."
__label__1	"I had a salad with the wings, and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied."
__label__0	I'm not really sure how Joey's was voted best hot dog in the Valley by readers of Phoenix Magazine.
__label__1	The best place to go for a tasty bowl of Pho!
__label__0	The live music on Fridays totally blows.
__label__0	I've never been more insulted or felt disrespected.
__label__1	Very friendly staff.
__label__1	It is worth the drive.
__label__1	"I had heard good things about this place, but it exceeding every hope I could have dreamed of."
__label__1	Food was great and so was the serivce!
__label__0	The warm beer didn't help.
__label__1	Great brunch spot.
__label__1	Service is friendly and inviting.
__label__1	Very good lunch spot.
__label__0	I've lived here since 1979 and this was the first (and last) time I've stepped foot into this place.
__label__0	The WORST EXPERIENCE EVER.
__label__0	Must have been an off night at this place.
__label__1	"The sides are delish - mixed mushrooms, yukon gold puree, white corn - beateous."
__label__0	"If that bug never showed up I would have given a 4 for sure, but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen."
__label__0	"For about 10 minutes, we we're waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasn't coming any time soon."
__label__1	My friend loved the salmon tartar.
__label__0	Won't go back.
__label__1	Extremely Tasty!
__label__1	Waitress was good though!
__label__0	Soggy and not good.
__label__1	The Jamaican mojitos are delicious.
__label__0	Which are small and not worth the price.
__label__1	#NAME?
__label__0	"The shower area is outside so you can only rinse, not take a full shower, unless you don't mind being nude for everyone to see!"
__label__0	The service was a bit lacking.
__label__0	"Lobster Bisque, Bussell Sprouts, Risotto, Filet ALL needed salt and pepper..and of course there is none at the tables."
__label__0	Hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in.
__label__0	"It was either too cold, not enough flavor or just bad."
__label__1	I loved the bacon wrapped dates.
__label__1	This is an unbelievable BARGAIN!
__label__1	The folks at Otto always make us feel so welcome and special.
__label__0	"As for the ""mains,"" also uninspired."
__label__1	This is the place where I first had pho and it was amazing!!
__label__1	This wonderful experience made this place a must-stop whenever we are in town again.
__label__0	"If the food isn't bad enough for you, then enjoy dealing with the world's worst/annoying drunk people."
__label__1	Very very fun chef.
__label__0	"Ordered a double cheeseburger & got a single patty that was falling apart (picture uploaded) Yeah, still sucks."
__label__1	Great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with TV's.
__label__0	"If it were possible to give them zero stars, they'd have it."
__label__0	"The descriptions said ""yum yum sauce"" and another said ""eel sauce"", yet another said ""spicy mayo""...well NONE of the rolls had sauces on them."
__label__1	"I'd say that would be the hardest decision... Honestly, all of M's dishes taste how they are supposed to taste (amazing)."
__label__0	If she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed... Not sure if we will go back and try it again.
__label__1	"Everyone is very attentive, providing excellent customer service."
__label__0	Horrible - don't waste your time and money.
__label__1	Now this dish was quite flavourful.
__label__0	By this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse.
__label__0	"(It wasn't busy either) Also, the building was FREEZING cold."
__label__0	"like the other reviewer said ""you couldn't pay me to eat at this place again."""
__label__0	-Drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point.
__label__1	"Seriously flavorful delights, folks."
__label__1	Much better than the other AYCE sushi place I went to in Vegas.
__label__1	The lighting is just dark enough to set the mood.
__label__0	Based on the sub-par service I received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business I won't be going back.
__label__1	Owner's are really great people.!
__label__0	There is nothing privileged about working/eating there.
__label__1	The Greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful.
__label__0	"Overall, I don't think that I would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that I silently felt too."
__label__1	Now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty.
__label__1	We had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast.
__label__1	Fantastic service here.
__label__0	I as well would've given godfathers zero stars if possible.
__label__1	They know how to make them here.
__label__0	very tough and very short on flavor!
__label__1	I hope this place sticks around.
__label__0	"I have been in more than a few bars in Vegas, and do not ever recall being charged for tap water."
__label__1	The restaurant atmosphere was exquisite.
__label__1	"Good service, very clean, and inexpensive, to boot!"
__label__1	The seafood was fresh and generous in portion.
__label__1	"Plus, it's only 8 bucks."
__label__0	"The service was not up to par, either."
__label__1	"Thus far, have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time."
__label__1	Just as good as when I had it more than a year ago!
__label__0	"For a self proclaimed coffee cafe, I was wildly disappointed."
__label__1	The Veggitarian platter is out of this world!
__label__1	You cant go wrong with any of the food here.
__label__1	You can't beat that.
__label__1	"Stopped by this place while in Madison for the Ironman, very friendly, kind staff."
__label__1	The chefs were friendly and did a good job.
__label__0	"I've had better, not only from dedicated boba tea spots, but even from Jenni Pho."
__label__1	I liked the patio and the service was outstanding.
__label__1	The goat taco didn't skimp on the meat and wow what FLAVOR!
__label__0	I think not again
__label__0	I had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so I will not be getting that again.
__label__1	I went to Bachi Burger on a friend's recommendation and was not disappointed.
__label__0	Service stinks here!
__label__0	I waited and waited.
__label__0	"This place is not quality sushi, it is not a quality restaurant."
__label__1	I would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza.
__label__1	Great Pizza and Salads!
__label__0	Things that went wrong: - They burned the saganaki.
__label__0	We waited an hour for what was a breakfast I could have done 100 times better at home.
__label__1	This place is amazing!
__label__0	"I hate to disagree with my fellow Yelpers, but my husband and I were so disappointed with this place."
__label__0	Waited 2 hours & never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did!
__label__0	Just don't know why they were so slow.
__label__1	"The staff is great, the food is delish, and they have an incredible beer selection."
__label__0	"I live in the neighborhood so I am disappointed I won't be back here, because it is a convenient location."
__label__1	I didn't know pulled pork could be soooo delicious.
__label__1	"You get incredibly fresh fish, prepared with care."
__label__0	Before I go in to why I gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at Bachi burger before writing a review.
__label__1	I love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it.
__label__0	Never again will I be dining at this place!
__label__1	The food was excellent and service was very good.
__label__1	Good beer & drink selection and good food selection.
__label__0	Please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles.
__label__0	The potato chip order was sad... I could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12.
__label__0	Food was really boring.
__label__1	Good Service-check!
__label__0	This greedy corporation will NEVER see another dime from me!
__label__0	"Will never, ever go back."
__label__0	"As much as I'd like to go back, I can't get passed the atrocious service and will never return."
__label__1	"In the summer, you can dine in a charming outdoor patio - so very delightful."
__label__1	I did not expect this to be so good!
__label__1	Fantastic food!
__label__0	She ordered a toasted English muffin that came out untoasted.
__label__1	The food was very good.
__label__0	Never going back.
__label__1	"Great food for the price, which is very high quality and house made."
__label__0	The bus boy on the other hand was so rude.
__label__0	"By this point, my friends and I had basically figured out this place was a joke and didn't mind making it publicly and loudly known."
__label__1	"Back to good BBQ, lighter fare, reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways."
__label__1	"And considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about $20, you just can't go wrong."
__label__1	All the bread is made in-house!
__label__0	The only downside is the service.
__label__0	"Also, the fries are without a doubt the worst fries I've ever had."
__label__1	Service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews.
__label__1	"A couple of months later, I returned and had an amazing meal."
__label__1	Favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma!!!!!!
__label__1	The black eyed peas and sweet potatoes... UNREAL!
__label__1	You won't be disappointed.
__label__1	"They could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish, but it was still very good."
__label__0	"I go to far too many places and I've never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast, especially for $4.00."
__label__0	When my mom and I got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad.
__label__0	The servers are not pleasant to deal with and they don't always honor Pizza Hut coupons.
__label__1	"Both of them were truly unbelievably good, and I am so glad we went back."
__label__1	"We had fantastic service, and were pleased by the atmosphere."
__label__0	Everything was gross.
__label__1	I love this place.
__label__1	Great service and food.
__label__0	First - the bathrooms at this location were dirty- Seat covers were not replenished & just plain yucky!!!
__label__0	"The burger... I got the ""Gold Standard"" a $17 burger and was kind of disappointed."
__label__1	"OMG, the food was delicioso!"
__label__0	There is nothing authentic about this place.
__label__0	the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever.
__label__1	"Of all the dishes, the salmon was the best, but all were great."
__label__1	The vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic Thai.
__label__1	It's worth driving up from Tucson!
__label__0	The selection was probably the worst I've seen in Vegas.....there was none.
__label__1	Pretty good beer selection too.
__label__1	"This place is like Chipotle, but BETTER."
__label__1	"Classy/warm atmosphere, fun and fresh appetizers, succulent steaks (Baseball steak!!!!!"
__label__1	5 stars for the brick oven bread app!
__label__1	"I have eaten here multiple times, and each time the food was delicious."
__label__0	We sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left.
__label__0	He was terrible!
__label__1	Everyone is treated equally special.
__label__0	It shouldn't take 30 min for pancakes and eggs.
__label__1	It was delicious!!!
__label__1	"On the good side, the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic - a real treat."
__label__0	"Sadly, Gordon Ramsey's Steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to Vegas."
__label__1	As always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious!
__label__1	Best fish I've ever had in my life!
__label__1	(The bathroom is just next door and very nice.)
__label__0	The buffet is small and all the food they offered was BLAND.
__label__1	This is an Outstanding little restaurant with some of the Best Food I have ever tasted.
__label__1	Pretty cool I would say.
__label__0	Definitely a turn off for me & i doubt I'll be back unless someone else is buying.
__label__1	Server did a great job handling our large rowdy table.
__label__0	"I find wasting food to be despicable, but this just wasn't food."
__label__0	My wife had the Lobster Bisque soup which was lukewarm.
__label__1	Would come back again if I had a sushi craving while in Vegas.
__label__1	"The staff are great, the ambiance is great."
__label__1	He deserves 5 stars.
__label__0	I left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day.
__label__0	They dropped more than the ball.
__label__1	"The dining space is tiny, but elegantly decorated and comfortable."
__label__1	"They will customize your order any way you'd like, my usual is Eggplant with Green Bean stir fry, love it!"
__label__0	And the beans and rice were mediocre at best.
__label__1	Best tacos in town by far!!
__label__0	I took back my money and got outta there.
__label__1	"In an interesting part of town, this place is amazing."
__label__0	RUDE & INCONSIDERATE MANAGEMENT.
__label__0	"The staff are now not as friendly, the wait times for being served are horrible, no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes."
__label__0	I won't be back.
__label__1	They have great dinners.
__label__1	The service was outshining & I definitely recommend the Halibut.
__label__0	The food was terrible.
__label__0	WILL NEVER EVER GO BACK AND HAVE TOLD MANY PEOPLE WHAT HAD HAPPENED.
__label__0	I don't recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving.
__label__1	I will come back here every time I'm in Vegas.
__label__0	This place deserves one star and 90% has to do with the food.
__label__0	This is a disgrace.
__label__1	Def coming back to bowl next time
__label__1	"If you want healthy authentic or ethic food, try this place."
__label__1	I will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night ... highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area.
__label__1	"I have been here several times in the past, and the experience has always been great."
__label__1	We walked away stuffed and happy about our first Vegas buffet experience.
__label__1	Service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is Vegas and located inside the Crystals shopping mall by Aria.
__label__1	"To summarize... the food was incredible, nay, transcendant... but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser."
__label__0	I'm probably one of the few people to ever go to Ians and not like it.
__label__1	Kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos!
__label__1	Service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see.
__label__1	Cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable.
__label__0	This one is simply a disappointment.
__label__0	"Overall, I was very disappointed with the quality of food at Bouchon."
__label__0	I don't have to be an accountant to know I'm getting screwed!
__label__1	"Great place to eat, reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the San Francisco Bay Area."
__label__1	Today was my first taste of a Buldogis Gourmet Hot Dog and I have to tell you it was more than I ever thought possible.
__label__0	Left very frustrated.
__label__1	I'll definitely be in soon again.
__label__1	Food was really good and I got full petty fast.
__label__1	Service was fantastic.
__label__0	TOTAL WASTE OF TIME.
__label__1	I don't know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea.
__label__1	"Come hungry, leave happy and stuffed!"
__label__0	"For service, I give them no stars."
__label__1	I can assure you that you won't be disappointed.
__label__0	I can take a little bad service but the food sucks.
__label__0	Gave up trying to eat any of the crust (teeth still sore).
__label__0	But now I was completely grossed out.
__label__1	I really enjoyed eating here.
__label__1	First time going but I think I will quickly become a regular.
__label__1	"Our server was very nice, and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs, he stayed professional and friendly until the end."
__label__1	From what my dinner companions told me...everything was very fresh with nice texture and taste.
__label__0	"On the ground, right next to our table was a large, smeared, been-stepped-in-and-tracked-everywhere pile of green bird poop."
__label__0	"Furthermore, you can't even find hours of operation on the website!"
__label__0	We've tried to like this place but after 10+ times I think we're done with them.
__label__0	What a mistake that was!
__label__1	No complaints!
__label__1	This is some seriously good pizza and I'm an expert/connisseur on the topic.
__label__0	Waiter was a jerk.
__label__0	"Strike 2, who wants to be rushed."
__label__1	These are the nicest restaurant owners I've ever come across.
__label__0	I never come again.
__label__1	We loved the biscuits!!!
__label__1	Service is quick and friendly.
__label__0	Ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes.
__label__1	So absolutley fantastic.
__label__0	It was a huge awkward 1.5lb piece of cow that was 3/4ths gristle and fat.
__label__1	definitely will come back here again.
__label__1	I like Steiners because it's dark and it feels like a bar.
__label__1	Wow very spicy but delicious.
__label__1	"If you're not familiar, check it out."
__label__0	I'll take my business dinner dollars elsewhere.
__label__1	I'd love to go back.
__label__1	"Anyway, this FS restaurant has a wonderful breakfast/lunch."
__label__0	Nothing special.
__label__1	Each day of the week they have a different deal and it's all so delicious!
__label__1	"Not to mention the combination of pears, almonds and bacon is a big winner!"
__label__0	Will not be back.
__label__0	Sauce was tasteless.
__label__1	"The food is delicious and just spicy enough, so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way."
__label__1	My ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor.
__label__0	I don't think we'll be going back anytime soon.
__label__1	Food was so gooodd.
__label__0	I am far from a sushi connoisseur but I can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food.
__label__0	I was so insulted.
__label__0	The last 3 times I had lunch here has been bad.
__label__0	The chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat I have ever eaten.
__label__1	"The food was very good and I enjoyed every mouthful, an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc."
__label__1	Nargile - I think you are great.
__label__1	Best tater tots in the southwest.
__label__1	We loved the place.
__label__0	Definitely not worth the $3 I paid.
__label__1	The vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole (choux) pastry was fresh enough.
__label__1	Im in AZ all the time and now have my new spot.
__label__0	The manager was the worst.
__label__1	The inside is really quite nice and very clean.
__label__1	The food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable.
__label__0	I don't think I'll be running back to Carly's anytime soon for food.
__label__0	"This is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged, then another 35 minutes to get our food...and they kept forgetting things."
__label__1	"Love the margaritas, too!"
__label__1	This was my first and only Vegas buffet and it did not disappoint.
__label__1	"Very good, though!"
__label__0	The one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading.
__label__1	Great pork sandwich.
__label__0	Don't waste your time here.
__label__0	"Total letdown, I would much rather just go to the Camelback Flower Shop and Cartel Coffee."
__label__0	"Third, the cheese on my friend's burger was cold."
__label__1	We enjoy their pizza and brunch.
__label__1	The steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked.
__label__1	We had a group of 70+ when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully.
__label__1	I LOVED it!
__label__0	We asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didn't bring that either.
__label__1	"This place is a jewel in Las Vegas, and exactly what I've been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here."
__label__0	Seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh.
__label__0	The selection of food was not the best.
__label__1	Delicious and I will absolutely be back!
__label__1	"This isn't a small family restaurant, this is a fine dining establishment."
__label__1	They had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and I liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle.
__label__0	I dont think I will be back for a very long time.
__label__0	"It was attached to a gas station, and that is rarely a good sign."
__label__1	How awesome is that.
__label__1	I will be back many times soon.
__label__1	The menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide!
__label__0	"Worse of all, he humiliated his worker right in front of me..Bunch of horrible name callings."
__label__1	CONCLUSION: Very filling meals.
__label__1	Their daily specials are always a hit with my group.
__label__0	And then tragedy struck.
__label__1	The pancake was also really good and pretty large at that.
__label__1	"This was my first crawfish experience, and it was delicious!"
__label__1	Their monster chicken fried steak and eggs is my all time favorite.
__label__1	Waitress was sweet and funny.
__label__1	"I also had to taste my Mom's multi-grain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing, fluffy, and delicious!"
__label__0	"I'd rather eat airline food, seriously."
__label__1	Cant say enough good things about this place.
__label__1	The ambiance was incredible.
__label__1	The waitress and manager are so friendly.
__label__0	I would not recommend this place.
__label__0	Overall I wasn't very impressed with Noca.
__label__0	My gyro was basically lettuce only.
__label__0	Terrible service!
__label__0	Thoroughly disappointed!
__label__1	"I don't each much pasta, but I love the homemade /hand made pastas and thin pizzas here."
__label__1	"Give it a try, you will be happy you did."
__label__1	By far the BEST cheesecurds we have ever had!
__label__1	Reasonably priced also!
__label__1	Everything was perfect the night we were in.
__label__1	The food is very good for your typical bar food.
__label__0	it was a drive to get there.
__label__1	"At first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe - nice ambiance, clean, friendly staff."
__label__0	"Anyway, I do not think i will go back there."
__label__1	"Point your finger at any item on the menu, order it and you won't be disappointed."
__label__1	"Oh this is such a thing of beauty, this restaurant."
__label__1	If you haven't gone here GO NOW!
__label__0	"A greasy, unhealthy meal."
__label__0	first time there and might just be the last.
__label__1	Those burgers were amazing.
__label__0	"Similarly, the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late."
__label__0	And it was way to expensive.
__label__1	"Be sure to order dessert, even if you need to pack it to-go - the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for."
__label__1	This was my first time and I can't wait until the next.
__label__1	The bartender was also nice.
__label__1	Everything was good and tasty!
__label__1	This place is two thumbs up....way up.
__label__1	"The best place in Vegas for breakfast (just check out a Sat, or Sun."
__label__1	"If you love authentic Mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting, yet delicious meats to choose from, you need to try this place."
__label__0	Terrible management.
__label__1	An excellent new restaurant by an experienced Frenchman.
__label__0	If there were zero stars I would give it zero stars.
__label__1	"Great steak, great sides, great wine, amazing desserts."
__label__0	Worst martini ever!
__label__1	The steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at GC.
__label__1	I had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas!
__label__0	We waited for thirty minutes to be seated (although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting).
__label__1	The yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh.
__label__0	I won't try going back there even if it's empty.
__label__0	"No, I'm going to eat the potato that I found some strangers hair in it."
__label__1	Just spicy enough.. Perfect actually.
__label__1	Last night was my second time dining here and I was so happy I decided to go back!
__label__0	"not even a ""hello, we will be right with you."""
__label__0	The desserts were a bit strange.
__label__1	My boyfriend and I came here for the first time on a recent trip to Vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service.
__label__1	"I really do recommend this place, you can go wrong with this donut place!"
__label__1	Nice ambiance.
__label__1	I would recommend saving room for this!
__label__0	I guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful.
__label__0	"However, my recent experience at this particular location was not so good."
__label__0	"I know this is not like the other restaurants at all, something is very off here!"
__label__0	AVOID THIS ESTABLISHMENT!
__label__0	I think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough.
__label__1	All of the tapas dishes were delicious!
__label__1	I *heart* this place.
__label__0	My salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of Palm.
__label__0	After two I felt disgusting.
__label__1	A good time!
__label__1	I believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi.
__label__1	Generous portions and great taste.
__label__0	I will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone!
__label__0	"The servers went back and forth several times, not even so much as an ""Are you being helped?"""
__label__1	Food was delicious!
__label__0	AN HOUR... seriously?
__label__0	I consider this theft.
__label__0	Eew... This location needs a complete overhaul.
__label__0	We recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well.
__label__0	Waited and waited and waited.
__label__1	"He also came back to check on us regularly, excellent service."
__label__1	Our server was super nice and checked on us many times.
__label__0	"The pizza tasted old, super chewy in not a good way."
__label__0	I swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed.
__label__1	Service was good and the company was better!
__label__1	The staff are also very friendly and efficient.
__label__1	"As for the service: I'm a fan, because it's quick and you're being served by some nice folks."
__label__0	Boy was that sucker dry!!.
__label__0	Over rated.
__label__0	"If you look for authentic Thai food, go else where."
__label__1	Their steaks are 100% recommended!
__label__0	After I pulled up my car I waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged.
__label__1	Great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting.
__label__1	"All in all, I can assure you I'll be back."
__label__0	I hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives.
__label__1	"My breakfast was perpared great, with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of Toast, lightly dusted with powdered sugar."
__label__0	The kids play area is NASTY!
__label__1	Great place fo take out or eat in.
__label__1	The waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for vegan/veggie options.
__label__1	OMG I felt like I had never eaten Thai food until this dish.
__label__0	"It was extremely ""crumby"" and pretty tasteless."
__label__0	It was a pale color instead of nice and char and has NO flavor.
__label__1	The croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus.
__label__0	I got home to see the driest damn wings ever!
__label__1	It'll be a regular stop on my trips to Phoenix!
__label__1	I really enjoyed Crema Café before they expanded. I even told friends they had the BEST breakfast.
__label__0	Not good for the money.
__label__1	I miss it and wish they had one in Philadelphia!
__label__0	"We got sitting fairly fast, but, ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order, another 30 minutes before the food arrived."
__label__1	They also have the best cheese crisp in town.
__label__1	"Good value, great food, great service."
__label__1	Couldn't ask for a more satisfying meal.
__label__1	The food is good.
__label__1	It was awesome.
__label__0	I just wanted to leave.
__label__1	We made the drive all the way from North Scottsdale... and I was not one bit disappointed!
__label__0	I will not be eating there again.
__label__0	!....THE OWNERS REALLY REALLY need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one!
__label__0	I checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed.
__label__0	"The chicken I got was definitely reheated and was only ok, the wedges were cold and soggy."
__label__0	"Sorry, I will not be getting food from here anytime soon :("
__label__1	An absolute must visit!
__label__1	The cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing.
__label__0	My friend did not like his Bloody Mary.
__label__0	"Despite how hard I rate businesses, its actually rare for me to give a 1 star."
__label__1	They really want to make your experience a good one.
__label__0	I will not return.
__label__0	I had the chicken Pho and it tasted very bland.
__label__0	Very disappointing!!!
__label__1	The grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning.
__label__0	"a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food, but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait."
__label__1	Pretty awesome place.
__label__1	Ambience is perfect.
__label__0	Best of luck to the rude and non-customer service focused new management.
__label__0	Any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one.
__label__0	I asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored I went to the hostess and got one myself.
__label__1	"The staff is always super friendly and helpful, which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby!"
__label__1	Four stars for the food & the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe & still letting us in to eat !
__label__1	The roast beef sandwich tasted really good!
__label__0	"Same evening, him and I are both drastically sick."
__label__1	High-quality chicken on the chicken Caesar salad.
__label__0	Ordered burger rare came in we'll done.
__label__1	We were promptly greeted and seated.
__label__0	Tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse.
__label__1	"I was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar, not only because the quality is great, but the service is fast and the food, impeccable."
__label__0	"After waiting an hour and being seated, I was not in the greatest of moods."
__label__1	This is a good joint.
__label__1	The Macarons here are insanely good.
__label__0	I'm not eating here!
__label__1	"Our waiter was very attentive, friendly, and informative."
__label__0	Maybe if they weren't cold they would have been somewhat edible.
__label__0	This place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver.
__label__0	Very bad Experience!
__label__0	What a mistake.
__label__0	Food was average at best.
__label__1	Great food.
__label__0	We won't be going back anytime soon!
__label__0	Very Very Disappointed ordered the $35 Big Bay Plater.
__label__1	Great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer.
__label__1	It is PERFECT for a sit-down family meal or get together with a few friends.
__label__0	"Not much flavor to them, and very poorly constructed."
__label__1	The patio seating was very comfortable.
__label__0	The fried rice was dry as well.
__label__1	Hands down my favorite Italian restaurant!
__label__1	"That just SCREAMS ""LEGIT"" in my book...somethat's also pretty rare here in Vegas."
__label__1	It was just not a fun experience.
__label__1	The atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested.
__label__1	"I personally love the hummus, pita, baklava, falafels and Baba Ganoush (it's amazing what they do with eggplant!)."
__label__1	"Very convenient, since we were staying at the MGM!"
__label__1	The owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous.
__label__1	Both great!
__label__1	Eclectic selection.
__label__1	The sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as I have had.
__label__1	The staff was very attentive.
__label__1	And the chef was generous with his time (even came around twice so we can take pictures with him).
__label__1	"The owner used to work at Nobu, so this place is really similar for half the price."
__label__0	Google mediocre and I imagine Smashburger will pop up.
__label__0	dont go here.
__label__1	I promise they won't disappoint.
__label__0	As a sushi lover avoid this place by all means.
__label__1	What a great double cheeseburger!
__label__1	Awesome service and food.
__label__1	A fantastic neighborhood gem !!!
__label__1	I can't wait to go back.
__label__0	The plantains were the worst I've ever tasted.
__label__1	It's a great place and I highly recommend it.
__label__0	Service was slow and not attentive.
__label__1	"I gave it 5 stars then, and I'm giving it 5 stars now."
__label__0	Your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me.
__label__1	Dessert: Panna Cotta was amazing.
__label__1	"Very good food, great atmosphere.1"
__label__1	Damn good steak.
__label__0	Total brunch fail.
__label__1	"Prices are very reasonable, flavors are spot on, the sauce is home made, and the slaw is not drenched in mayo."
__label__1	"The decor is nice, and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant."
__label__1	The steak was amazing...rge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had!
__label__1	"Good food , good service ."
__label__1	It was absolutely amazing.
__label__0	"I probably won't be back, to be honest."
__label__1	will definitely be back!
__label__1	The sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well.
__label__1	"Hawaiian Breeze, Mango Magic, and Pineapple Delight are the smoothies that I've tried so far and they're all good."
__label__0	Went for lunch - service was slow.
__label__0	"We had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing, but was quickly disappointed."
__label__0	I was mortified.
__label__0	"Needless to say, we will never be back here again."
__label__0	"Anyways, The food was definitely not filling at all, and for the price you pay you should expect more."
__label__0	"The chips that came out were dripping with grease, and mostly not edible."
__label__0	I wasn't really impressed with Strip Steak.
__label__1	Have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome!!
__label__1	Our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff.
__label__1	The cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me.
__label__0	I work in the hospitality industry in Paradise Valley and have refrained from recommending Cibo any longer.
__label__1	The atmosphere here is fun.
__label__0	Would not recommend to others.
__label__1	"Service is quick and even ""to go"" orders are just like we like it!"
__label__0	"I mean really, how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when it's so terrible!?!"
__label__1	"That said, our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased."
__label__0	Not my thing.
__label__1	2 Thumbs Up!!
__label__0	If you are reading this please don't go there.
__label__1	"I loved the grilled pizza, reminded me of legit Italian pizza."
__label__1	Only Pros : Large seating area/ Nice bar area/ Great simple drink menu/ The BEST brick oven pizza with homemade dough!
__label__1	They have a really nice atmosphere.
__label__0	Tonight I had the Elk Filet special...and it sucked.
__label__1	"After one bite, I was hooked."
__label__0	We ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything.
__label__1	"Cute, quaint, simple, honest."
__label__1	The chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside.
__label__1	"The food was great as always, compliments to the chef."
__label__1	Special thanks to Dylan T. for the recommendation on what to order :) All yummy for my tummy.
__label__1	Awesome selection of beer.
__label__1	Great food and awesome service!
__label__1	"One nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8, and they didn't expect more tip than that."
__label__0	A FLY was in my apple juice.. A FLY!!!!!!!!
__label__1	The Han Nan Chicken was also very tasty.
__label__1	"As for the service, I thought it was good."
__label__0	"The food was barely lukewarm, so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us."
__label__0	Ryan's Bar is definitely one Edinburgh establishment I won't be revisiting.
__label__1	Nicest Chinese restaurant I've been in a while.
__label__1	"Overall, I like there food and the service."
__label__1	They also now serve Indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world.
__label__0	"Probably never coming back, and wouldn't recommend it."
__label__0	"Friend's pasta -- also bad, he barely touched it."
__label__1	"Try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy, friendly service."
__label__1	I love the decor with the Chinese calligraphy wall paper.
__label__1	Never had anything to complain about here.
__label__1	The restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it.
__label__0	It was way over fried.
__label__0	I'm not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place.
__label__0	"When I opened the sandwich, I was impressed, but not in a good way."
__label__0	Will not be back!
__label__1	There was a warm feeling with the service and I felt like their guest for a special treat.
__label__1	An extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast.
__label__1	"I always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner, which has a wide array of options to choose from."
__label__0	"I have watched their prices inflate, portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly!"
__label__1	Wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside.
__label__1	"I got to enjoy the seafood salad, with a fabulous vinegrette."
__label__1	"The wontons were thin, not thick and chewy, almost melt in your mouth."
__label__1	"Level 5 spicy was perfect, where spice didn't over-whelm the soup."
__label__1	We were sat right on time and our server from the get go was FANTASTIC!
__label__0	"Main thing I didn't enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd, around mid 30s and up."
__label__1	"When I'm on this side of town, this will definitely be a spot I'll hit up again!"
__label__0	I had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas.
__label__1	This is a GREAT place to eat!
__label__1	The jalapeno bacon is soooo good.
__label__0	The service was poor and thats being nice.
__label__1	"Food was good, service was good, Prices were good."
__label__0	The place was not clean and the food oh so stale!
__label__0	"The chicken dishes are OK, the beef is like shoe leather."
__label__0	But the service was beyond bad.
__label__1	"I'm so happy to be here!!!"""
__label__0	Tasted like dirt.
__label__1	One of the few places in Phoenix that I would definately go back to again .
__label__1	The block was amazing.
__label__1	"It's close to my house, it's low-key, non-fancy, affordable prices, good food."
__label__1	* Both the Hot & Sour & the Egg Flower Soups were absolutely 5 Stars!
__label__0	My sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless.
__label__1	Great time - family dinner on a Sunday night.
__label__0	"the food is not tasty at all, not to say its ""real traditional Hunan style""."
__label__0	"What did bother me, was the slow service."
__label__1	The flair bartenders are absolutely amazing!
__label__0	Their frozen margaritas are WAY too sugary for my taste.
__label__1	These were so good we ordered them twice.
__label__0	So in a nutshell: 1) The restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer.
__label__0	My girlfriend's veal was very bad.
__label__0	"Unfortunately, it was not good."
__label__1	I had a pretty satifying experience.
__label__1	Join the club and get awesome offers via email.
__label__1	"Perfect for someone (me) who only likes beer ice cold, or in this case, even colder."
__label__0	Bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat.
__label__0	"The chains, which I'm no fan of, beat this place easily."
__label__1	The nachos are a MUST HAVE!
__label__0	We will not be coming back.
__label__1	"I don't have very many words to say about this place, but it does everything pretty well."
__label__1	"The staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries, lawyers, and court staff."
__label__1	"Great atmosphere, friendly and fast service."
__label__1	When I received my Pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there.
__label__0	Once your food arrives it's meh.
__label__0	Paying $7.85 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kid's meal at the Wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal.
__label__1	The classic Maine Lobster Roll was fantastic.
__label__0	"My brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day, and guess what he was sick all night too."
__label__1	So good I am going to have to review this place twice - once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night.
__label__1	"The chips and salsa were really good, the salsa was very fresh."
__label__1	This place is great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
__label__0	Mediocre food.
__label__1	Once you get inside you'll be impressed with the place.
__label__0	I'm super pissd.
__label__1	And service was super friendly.
__label__0	Why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked?
__label__1	This place was such a nice surprise!
__label__1	They were golden-crispy and delicious.
__label__0	"I had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill, but unfortunately the taste fell flat, way flat."
__label__1	I could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine.
__label__0	Not a single employee came out to see if we were OK or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food.
__label__1	"Lastly, the mozzarella sticks, they were the best thing we ordered."
__label__1	"The first time I ever came here I had an amazing experience, I still tell people how awesome the duck was."
__label__0	The server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome... I would not suggest this place!
__label__0	The service was terrible though.
__label__0	"This place is overpriced, not consistent with their boba, and it really is OVERPRICED!"
__label__0	It was packed!!
__label__1	I love this place.
__label__1	I can say that the desserts were yummy.
__label__0	The food was terrible.
__label__1	The seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree.
__label__0	It kept getting worse and worse so now I'm officially done.
__label__0	This place should honestly be blown up.
__label__0	But I definitely would not eat here again.
__label__0	Do not waste your money here!
__label__1	I love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes.
__label__1	The crêpe was delicate and thin and moist.
__label__0	Awful service.
__label__0	Won't ever go here again.
__label__0	Food quality has been horrible.
__label__0	For that price I can think of a few place I would have much rather gone.
__label__0	The service here is fair at best.
__label__0	"I do love sushi, but I found Kabuki to be over-priced, over-hip and under-services."
__label__0	Do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish.
__label__0	Very poor service.
__label__0	No one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it.
__label__1	"Best service and food ever, Maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day."
__label__1	They were excellent.
__label__0	I paid the bill but did not tip because I felt the server did a terrible job.
__label__1	Just had lunch here and had a great experience.
__label__0	I have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor.
__label__0	Food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small.
__label__1	I recently tried Caballero's and I have been back every week since!
__label__0	"for 40 bucks a head, i really expect better food."
__label__1	The food came out at a good pace.
__label__1	"I ate there twice on my last visit, and especially enjoyed the salmon salad."
__label__0	I won't be back.
__label__0	We could not believe how dirty the oysters were!
__label__0	This place deserves no stars.
__label__0	I would not recommend this place.
__label__1	"In fact I'm going to round up to 4 stars, just because she was so awesome."
__label__0	"To my disbelief, each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods I have ever tasted."
__label__0	"Bad day or not, I have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people, it is your job to be nice and polite, wash dishes otherwise!!"
__label__1	the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit.
__label__0	I probably would not go here again.
__label__1	So flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat.
__label__1	The price is reasonable and the service is great.
__label__0	"The Wife hated her meal (coconut shrimp), and our friends really did not enjoy their meals, either."
__label__0	My fella got the huevos rancheros and they didn't look too appealing.
__label__1	"Went in for happy hour, great list of wines."
__label__1	Some may say this buffet is pricey but I think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot!
__label__0	I probably won't be coming back here.
__label__0	Worst food/service I've had in a while.
__label__1	"This place is pretty good, nice little vibe in the restaurant."
__label__1	Talk about great customer service of course we will be back.
__label__0	"Hot dishes are not hot, cold dishes are close to room temp.I watched staff prepare food with BARE HANDS, no gloves.Everything is deep fried in oil."
__label__1	I love their fries and their beans.
__label__1	Always a pleasure dealing with him.
__label__1	"They have a plethora of salads and sandwiches, and everything I've tried gets my seal of approval."
__label__1	This place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer.
__label__1	"For sushi on the Strip, this is the place to go."
__label__1	"The service was great, even the manager came and helped with our table."
__label__0	The feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best.
__label__0	"I started this review with two stars, but I'm editing it to give it only one."
__label__0	this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides Costco's.
__label__1	"All in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service, a unique menu, and a beautiful setting."
__label__1	My boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience.
__label__0	Weird vibe from owners.
__label__0	There was hardly any meat.
__label__0	I've had better bagels from the grocery store.
__label__1	Go To Place for Gyros.
__label__1	"I love the owner/chef, his one authentic Japanese cool dude!"
__label__0	"Now the burgers aren't as good, the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless."
__label__0	I found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa.
__label__0	"The service was terrible, food was mediocre."
__label__1	We definately enjoyed ourselves.
__label__0	I ordered Albondigas soup - which was just warm - and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs.
__label__0	"On three different occasions I asked for well done or medium well, and all three times I got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate."
__label__0	I had about two bites and refused to eat anymore.
__label__0	The service was extremely slow.
__label__0	"After 20 minutes wait, I got a table."
__label__1	Seriously killer hot chai latte.
__label__0	"No allergy warnings on the menu, and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts."
__label__1	My boyfriend tried the Mediterranean Chicken Salad and fell in love.
__label__1	Their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place.
__label__0	Pricing is a bit of a concern at Mellow Mushroom.
__label__0	Worst Thai ever.
__label__1	If you stay in Vegas you must get breakfast here at least once.
__label__1	I want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service.
__label__1	The pizza selections are good.
__label__1	"I had strawberry tea, which was good."
__label__0	Highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron!
__label__1	"Overall, a great experience."
__label__0	Spend your money elsewhere.
__label__1	Their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter... Mmmm...!
__label__0	The Buffet at Bellagio was far from what I anticipated.
__label__0	"And the drinks are WEAK, people!"
__label__0	#NAME?
__label__0	"Also, I feel like the chips are bought, not made in house."
__label__0	After the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert.
__label__1	The chips and sals a here is amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
__label__0	We won't be returning.
__label__1	This is my new fav Vegas buffet spot.
__label__0	I seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off.
__label__0	"Very, very sad."
__label__0	"i felt insulted and disrespected, how could you talk and judge another human being like that?"
__label__0	"How can you call yourself a steakhouse if you can't properly cook a steak, I don't understand!"
__label__0	I'm not impressed with the concept or the food.
__label__0	The only thing I wasn't too crazy about was their guacamole as I don't like it puréed.
__label__0	"There is really nothing for me at postinos, hope your experience is better"
__label__0	I got food poisoning here at the buffet.
__label__0	They brought a fresh batch of fries and I was thinking yay something warm but no!
__label__0	"What SHOULD have been a hilarious, yummy Christmas Eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us."
__label__0	"Needless to say, I won't be going back anytime soon."
__label__0	This place is disgusting!
__label__1	"Every time I eat here, I see caring teamwork to a professional degree."
__label__0	The RI style calamari was a joke.
__label__0	"However, there was so much garlic in the fondue, it was barely edible."
__label__0	"I could barely stomach the meal, but didn't complain because it was a business lunch."
__label__0	"It was so bad, I had lost the heart to finish it."
__label__0	It also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it.
__label__0	We aren't ones to make a scene at restaurants but I just don't get it...definitely lost the love after this one!
__label__0	Disappointing experience.
__label__0	"The food is about on par with Denny's, which is to say, not good at all."
__label__0	"If you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service, then this is the place for you."
__label__0	WAAAAAAyyyyyyyyyy over rated is all I am saying.
__label__0	We won't be going back.
__label__0	The place was fairly clean but the food simply wasn't worth it.
__label__0	This place lacked style!!
__label__0	"The sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was $12, ridiculous."
__label__0	Don't bother coming here.
__label__0	"The meat was pretty dry, I had the sliced brisket and pulled pork."
__label__0	"The building itself seems pretty neat, the bathroom is pretty trippy, but I wouldn't eat here again."
__label__0	It was equally awful.
__label__0	Probably not in a hurry to go back.
__label__0	very slow at seating even with reservation.
__label__0	Not good by any stretch of the imagination.
__label__0	The cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked.
__label__0	"The chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless, seemed thin and watered down with no heat."
__label__0	"It was a bit too sweet, not really spicy enough, and lacked flavor."
__label__0	I was VERY disappointed!!
__label__0	This place is horrible and way overpriced.
__label__0	"Maybe it's just their Vegetarian fare, but I've been twice and I thought it was average at best."
__label__0	It wasn't busy at all and now we know why.
__label__0	The tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu.
__label__0	"The ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting, but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits."
__label__0	Con: spotty service.
__label__0	"The fries were not hot, and neither was my burger."
__label__0	But then they came back cold.
__label__0	"Then our food came out, disappointment ensued."
__label__0	The real disappointment was our waiter.
__label__0	My husband said she was very rude... did not even apologize for the bad food or anything.
__label__0	The only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach.
__label__0	"Insults, profound deuchebaggery, and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it."
__label__0	If someone orders two tacos don't' you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart?
__label__0	She was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door.
__label__0	After all the rave reviews I couldn't wait to eat here......what a disappointment!
__label__0	Del Taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible.
__label__0	It's NOT hard to make a decent hamburger.
__label__0	But I don't like it.
__label__0	Hell no will I go back
__label__0	We've have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant.
__label__0	"I don't know what the big deal is about this place, but I won't be back ""ya'all""."
__label__0	I immediately said I wanted to talk to the manager but I did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar.
__label__0	The ambiance isn't much better.
__label__0	"Unfortunately, it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees."
__label__0	The food wasn't good.
__label__0	"Your servers suck, wait, correction, our server Heimer sucked."
__label__0	What happened next was pretty....off putting.
__label__0	"too bad cause I know it's family owned, I really wanted to like this place."
__label__0	Overpriced for what you are getting.
__label__0	I vomited in the bathroom mid lunch.
__label__0	"I kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes, yet still no food."
__label__0	"I have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would I ever return to, and this tops the list."
__label__0	We started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasn't fresh.
__label__0	Food was below average.
__label__0	It sure does beat the nachos at the movies but I would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant.
__label__0	"All in all, Ha Long Bay was a bit of a flop."
__label__0	The problem I have is that they charge $11.99 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a Subway sub (which offers better and more amount of vegetables).
__label__0	Shrimp- When I unwrapped it (I live only 1/2 a mile from Brushfire) it was literally ice cold.
__label__0	"It lacked flavor, seemed undercooked, and dry."
__label__0	It really is impressive that the place hasn't closed down.
__label__0	I would avoid this place if you are staying in the Mirage.
__label__0	The refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland.
__label__0	Spend your money and time some place else.
__label__0	A lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar In her salad.
__label__0	the presentation of the food was awful.
__label__0	I can't tell you how disappointed I was.
__label__0	I think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking.
__label__0	Appetite instantly gone.
__label__0	Overall I was not impressed and would not go back.
__label__0	"The whole experience was underwhelming, and I think we'll just go to Ninja Sushi next time."
__label__0	"Then, as if I hadn't wasted enough of my life there, they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check."
