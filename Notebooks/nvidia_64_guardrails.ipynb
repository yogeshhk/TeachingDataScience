    "\n",
    "In the next notebook, we will use higher-level utilities to take our embedding model and use it under the hood. Before then, there are several essential concepts that we can explore while the raw methods are still fresh!\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, we can use it as a backbone for a critical component of productionalized models: **semantic guardrailing**. Specifically, we can use the embeddings to filter out messages that are unlikely to be useful (or are actively harmful) for our chatbot to answer!\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Advantage Over Autoregression-Guided Filtering**\n",
    "\n",
    "You may recall from the previous notebooks that we can use our LLMs to facilitate complex internal reasoning, so why not filter with that? Specifically, you may be jumping the idea of asking an LLM to judge the question and then branch using a `RunnableBranch.` In truth, you can definitely do that, but that system has some hard pros and cons that need further consideration:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Pros:** It is relatively quick and easy to prompt engineer your internal system to restrict the progression of dialog. You can even develop a routine that takes examples of good and bad questions and generates a single compact prompt that consistently returns \"Good\" or \"Bad\" finite states.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> **Cons:** Using autoregressive routing usually comes with a handful of latency or resource overhead that might not be acceptable. For example, you may want to integrate a semantic guardrail mechanism behind the scenes that both prevents harmful outputs and steers problematic inputs toward safe and predictable directions. Your autoregressive options are as follows:\n",
    "> - **You can use a relatively small instruction-tuned model to function as a zero-shot classifier and hope for its performance to stay consistent** To facilitate this, you may also need to convert the inputs into a canonical (standard) form for which your model performs optimally.\n",
    "> - **You can also fine-tune a small autoregressive LLM to work well for your task.** You'll have to do some synthetic data curation and might need to spend some extra computing budget for a one-time fine-tuning cost, but this should at least allow a smaller model to mimic the performance of a larger prompt-engineered model by default.\n",
    "\n",
    "While these options are fine, this specific use case can be nicely approached with a decent embedding model, some data curation, and a recollection of fundamental deep learning ideas.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Specifically, we can use an embedding model as a language backbone and can then train a classifier on top of it to predict a probability**. We will explore this idea and address new challenges as they come up."

    "From these embeddings, we can train up a simple classifier that predicts whether an embedding is good or bad!\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite our CPU-bound environment assumptions, a simple two-layer network is likely to be sufficient for this use case since we're leveraging a strong embedding model backbone. Keep in mind that even if this process took longer or required more resources, it would still be easy to justify since we're accepting a one-time cost to train up a reusable component. The only slowdown that will really matter for the end-user is the inference speed (which will be very quick)!\n",

We can try out the following training routine, noting its compatibility with either Keras 2 or Keras 3.
