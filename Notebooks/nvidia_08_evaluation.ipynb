    "## **Part 1:** Pre-Release Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "In our previous notebook, we successfully combined several concepts to create a document chatbot with the aim of responsive and informative interactions. However, the diversity of user interactions necessitates comprehensive testing to truly understand the chatbot's performance. Thorough testing in varied scenarios is crucial to ensure that the system is not only robust and versatile but also aligns with user and provider expectations.\n",
    "\n",
    "After defining your chatbot's roles and implementing the necessary features, evaluating it becomes a multi-stage process:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Typical Use Inspection:** Start by testing scenarios most relevant to your use case. See if your chatbot can reliably navigate discussions with limited human intervention.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Additionally, identify limitations or compartments that should be redirected to a human for inspection/supervision (i.e., human swap-in to confirm transactions or perform sensitive navigation) and implement those options.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Edge Case Inspection:** Explore the boundaries of typical use, identifying how the chatbot handles less common but plausible scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Before any public release, assess critical boundary conditions that could pose liability risks, such as the potential generation of inappropriate content.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Implement well-tested guardrails on all outputs (and possibly inputs) to limit undesired interactions and redirect users into predictable conversation flows.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Progressive Rollout:** Rolling out your model to a limited audience (first internal, then [A/B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A/B_testing)) and implement analytics features like usage analytics dashboards and feedback avenues (flag/like/dislike/etc).\n",
    "\n",
    "Of these three steps, the first two can be done by a small team or an individual and should be iterated on as part of the development process. Unfortunately, this needs to be done frequently and can be prone to human error. **Luckily for us, LLMs can be used to help out with LLM-as-a-Judge formulations!**\n",
    "\n",
    "*(Yeah, this probably isn't surprising by now. LLMs being strong is why this course is here...).*\n",
    "\n",
    "----\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Part 2:** LLM-as-a-Judge Formulation\n",
    "\n",
    "In the realm of conversational AI, using LLMs as evaluators or 'judges' has emerged as a useful approach for configurable automatic testing of natural language task performance:\n",
    "\n",
    "- An LLM can simulate a range of interaction scenarios and generate synthetic data, allowing an evaluation developer to generate targeted inputs to eliciting a range of behaviors from your chatbot.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The chatbot's correspondence/retrieval on the synthetic data can be evaluated or parsed by an LLM and a consistent output format such as \"Pass\"/\"Fail\", similarity, or extraction can be enforced.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Many such results can be aggregated and a metric can be derived which explains something like \"% of passing evaluations\", \"average number of relevant details from the sources\", \"average cosine similarity\", etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "This idea of using LLMs to test out and quantify chatbot quality, known as [**\"LLM-as-a-Judge,\"**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05685) allows for easy test specifications that align closely with human judgment and can be fine-tuned and replicated at scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "**There are several popular frameworks for off-the-shelf judge formulations including:**\n",
    "- [**RAGAs (short for RAG Assessment)**](https://docs.ragas.io/en/stable/), which offers a suite of great starting points for your own evaluation efforts.\n",
    "- [**LangChain Evaluators**](https://python.langchain.com/docs/guides/evaluation/), which are similar first-party options with many implicitly-constructible agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of using the chains as-is, we will instead expand on the ideas and evaluate our system with a more custom solution."

    "## **Part 4:** Advanced Formulations\n",
    "\n",
    "The exercise above was meant to prepare you for the final assessment of the course and showcased a simple but effective evaluator chain. The objective and implementation details were provided for you, and the logic for using it probably makes sense now that you've seen it in action. \n",
    "\n",
    "With that being said, this metric was merely a product of us specifying:\n",
    "- **What kind of behavior is important for our pipeline to have?**\n",
    "- **What do we need to do in order to exhibit and evaluate this behavior?**\n",
    "\n",
    "From these two questions, we could have come up with plenty of other evaluation metrics that could have assessed different attributes, incorporated different evaluator chain techniques, and even required different pipeline organization strategies. Though far from an exhaustive list, some common formulations you will likely come across may include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Style Evaluation:** Some evaluation formulations can be as simple as \"let me ask some questions and see if the output feels desirable.\" This might be used to see whether a chatbot \"acts like it's supposed to\" based on a description provided to a judge LLM. We're using quotations since this kind of assessment can reasonably be achieved with nothing but prompt engineering and a while loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Ground-Truth Evaluation:** In our chain, we used synthetic generation to create some random questions and answers using a sampling strategy, but in reality you may actually have some representative questions and answers that you need your chatbot to consistently get right! In this case, a modification of the exercise chain above should be implemented and closely monitored as you develop your pipelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Retrieval/Augmentation Evaluation:** This course made many assumptions about what kinds of preprocessing and prompting steps would be good for your pipelines, and much of this was determined by experimentation. Factors such as document preprocessing, chunking strategies, model selection, and prompt specification all played important roles, so creating metrics to validate these decisions may be of interest. This kind of metric might require your pipeline to output your context chunks or may even rely solely on embedding similarity comparisons, so keep this in mind when trying to implement a chain that works with multiple evaluation strategies. Consider the [**RagasEvaluatorChain**](https://docs.ragas.io/en/latest/howtos/integrations/langchain.html) abstraction as a decent starting point for making an custom generalizable evaluation routine. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Trajectory Evaluation:** Using more advanced agent formulations, you can implement multiple-query strategies that assume the presence of conversational memory. With this, you can implement an evaluation agent which can:\n",
    "    - Ask a series of questions in order to evaluate how well the agent is able to adapt and cater to the scenario. This kind of system generally considers a series of correspondence and aims to tease out and evaluate a \"trajectory\" of how the agent navigated the conversation. The [**LangChain Trajectory Evaluators documentation**](https://python.langchain.com/docs/guides/evaluation/trajectory/) is a good starting point.\n",
    "    - Alternatively, you could also implement an evaluation agent that tries to achieve objectives by interacting with the chatbot. Such an agent can output whether they were able to navigate to their solution in a natural manner, and can even be used to generate a report about the percieved performance. The [**LangChain Agents documentation**](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/agents/concepts) is a good starting point!\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of the day, just make sure to use the tools you have at your disposal appropriately. By this point in the course, you should already be well-acquainted with the LLM core value propositions: **They're powerful, scalable, predictable, controllable, and orchestratable... but will act unpredictably when you just expect them to work by default.** Assess your needs, formulate and validate your pipelines, give enough information, and add as much control as you can to make your system work consistently, efficiently, and effectively."

Your objective is to invoke that series of commands by using your pipeline to pass the Evaluation check! Recall [`35_langserve.ipynb`](35_langserve.ipynb) and use it as a starting example! As a recommendation, consider duplicating it so that you can keep the original as an authoritative reference. \n",
