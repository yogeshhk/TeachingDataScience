	\begin{itemize}
	\item Calling to an IVR (Integrated Voice Response)
	\item A pre-recorded menu selection.
	\item ``Please press 1 for Account Details, Please press 2 for \ldots''
	\item Till it comes to your option. 
	\item Else, you are given access to a person to talk to.
	\end{itemize}

Boring? Annoying? But still heavily used \ldots, Why?

 \begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Why so many chatbot startups?}
\begin{itemize}
\item VCs appear excited with this new tool, more services, more opportunities, new battlegrounds for the big players (likely leading to acquisitions). 
\item So even without real technological breakthroughs, there is at least some money to be made investing in bot startups.
\item But the real issue is : Truly ‘conversational' software is a difficult problem to solve.

\begin{itemize}
\item Command \& response: Stateless bots are essentially a command line app over HTTP
\item Hard-coded conversation flows: navigate a flow chart defined. http://superscriptjs.com/ allows that. Evi is an intelligent bot built with “knowledge base” technology.
\item Fuzzy/continuous/fluid state: that’s the goal. Human conversations don’t follow a template

    \begin{column}[t]{0.5\linewidth}

\begin{itemize}
\item Retrieval-based models (easier) use a repository of predefined responses and some kind of heuristic to pick an appropriate response based on the input and context. 
\item Generative models (harder) are based on Machine Translation techniques, but instead of translating from one language to another, we “translate” from an input to an output (response).
\end{itemize}
    \end{column}

% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% \begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Retrieval based chatbot}

% The way it works:

% \begin{itemize}
% \item You supply FAQs in the form of csv (comma separated file) having Question-Answer-Class in each row (e.g. "What is GST rate for Toothpaste?,12,rate")
% \item Questions are vectorized and kept ready for matching, along with the classifier model [X=vector(question), y=class]
% \item Once user query comes, its 'class' is predicted using the classifier model and within the class, vectorized query is matched against existing vectorized questions.
% \item Whichever is most similar, it's answer is presented to the user.
% \end{itemize}


% So,
% \begin{itemize}
% \item Similarity based
% \item Atomic
% \item Can handle simple questions and respond with pre-built responses based on rule-based conversation processing. 
% \item For instance, if user says X, respond with Y; if user says Z, call a REST API, and so forth.

% \begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Dialog flow based chatbot}

% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% \begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Level 1 : Notification Assistants}
% \begin{itemize}
% \item The chatbot is essentially a traditional notification assistant; it can answer a question with a pre-built response. 
% \item It can send you notifications about certain events or reminders about things in which you’ve explicitly expressed interest. 
% \item For instance, a level 1 travel bot can provide a link for you to book travel.

% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% \begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Level 3 : Contextual Assistants}
% \begin{itemize}
% \item the contextual assistant can engage in a flexible back-and-forth with you and offer more than prebuilt answers because it knows how to respond to unexpected user utterances. 
% \item The assistant also begins to understand context at this point. 
% \item For instance, the travel bot will be able to walk you through a few popular destinations and make the necessary travel arrangements.
