\begin{itemize}

\item At its simplest, a vector is an entity that has both magnitude and direction. 
\item The magnitude represents a distance (for example, ``2 miles'') and the direction indicates which way the vector is headed (for example,``East''). 
\item One more way is $\bar{v} = 2\hat{i} + 3\hat{j}$; meaning?
\item Is Magnitude-Direction form equivalent to i-j form?
\item Inter-convertible? How?
\item Can it have just two components?
\end{itemize}

Two-dimensional example:
\begin{itemize}

\item A vector that is defined by a point in a two-dimensional plane
\item A two dimensional coordinate consists of an x and a y value, and in this case we'll use 2 for x and 1 for y
\item Its is written in matrix form as : $\vec{v} = \begin{bmatrix}2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}$
\item Describes the movements required to get to the end point (of head) of the vector 
\item So, it is not a point in space. It gives Direction, like a movement recipe. 
\item When added to a point, results into a transformed point.
\item In this case, we need to move 2 units in the x dimension, and 1 unit in the y dimension
\end{itemize}

 \begin{frame}[fragile] \frametitle{Vectors}
Two-dimensional example:
\begin{itemize}

\item Note that we don't specify a starting point for the vector
\item We're simply describing a destination coordinate that encapsulate the magnitude and direction of the vector. 
\item Think about it as the directions you need to follow to get to {\bf there} from {\bf here}, without specifying where {\bf here} actually is!
\item Generally using the point 0,0 as the starting point (or origin). Also called as Position Vector.
\item Our vector of (2,1) is shown as an arrow that starts at 0,0 and moves 2 units along the x axis (to the right) and 1 unit along the y axis (up).
\end{itemize}

 \begin{frame}[fragile] \frametitle{Vectors}
Calculating Magnitude
\begin{itemize}

\item $\|\vec{v}\| = \sqrt{v_{1}\;^{2} + v_{2}\;^{2}}$
\item Double-bars are often used to avoid confusion with absolute values. 
\item Note that the components of the vector are indicated by subscript indices $(v_1, v_2,\ldots v_n)$
\item In this case, the vector v has two components with values 2 and 1, so our magnitude calculation is:
\item $\|\vec{v}\| = \sqrt{2^{2} + 1^{2}} = \sqrt{5} \approx 2.24$
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
 \begin{frame}[fragile] \frametitle{Vectors}
Calculating Direction
\begin{itemize}

\item We can get the angle of the vector by calculating the inverse tangent; sometimes known as the arctan
\item For our v vector (2,1):$tan(\theta) = \frac{1}{2}$
\item $\theta = tan^{-1} (0.5) \approx 26.57^{o}$
\item use the following rules:
\begin{itemize}

\item Both x and y are positive: Use the tan-1 value.
\item x is negative, y is positive: Add 180 to the tan-1 value.
\item Both x and y are negative: Add 180 to the tan-1 value.
\item x is positive, y is negative: Add 360 to the tan-1 value.

\textbf{Definition}
  A {\em vector} is a matrix with one column.

\item To add these vectors: We just add the individual components, so 3 plus 2
is 5; and 1 plus -4 is -3.
\item It is simply adding another leg to the journey; so if
we follow vector V along 3 and up 1, and then follow vector W along 2 and down 4,
we end up at the head of the vector we calculated by adding V and
W together.

Vector Multiplication is slightly complicated that plain Vector Addition. 

There are a few types of it.

\begin{itemize}
\item Scalar into Vector resulting in a vector: e.g. You have a list (a vector) of people's income. Tax rate is 15\%. How do you get a list of Tax amounts?
\item Vector into Vector resulting in a scalar: e.g. You have different amounts of foreign currencies. You know each ones conversion-to-INR rate. How do you compute total INRs you have?
\item Vector into Vector resulting in a vector: e.g. Area of a parallelogram with a right hand rule direction.

\item Now, dot product is given as $\vec{v}\cdot\vec{w} = v_1.w_1 + 0.w_2 = v_1.w_1$
\item Putting value of $w_1$, eqn becomes $= v_1.||\vec{w}||cos\theta = ||\vec{v}||||\vec{w}||cos\theta$

 $$
 u\cdot v = u^tv=\sum_{i=1}^n u_i v_i.
 $$


\textbf{Example}

\begin{frame}[fragile] \frametitle{Theorem}

Let $\vec{u}, \vec{v}, \vec{w} \in \mathbb R^n$ and let $c$  be a scalar.
Then 
\begin{itemize}
 \item $\vec{u}\cdot \vec{v} = \vec{v} \cdot \vec{u}$.
\item $(\vec{u} + \vec{v})\cdot \vec{w} = \vec{u}\cdot \vec{w}
+\vec{v}\cdot \vec{w}$.
\item $(c \vec{u})\cdot \vec{v}= c (\vec{u}\cdot \vec{v})$.
\item $\vec{u} \cdot \vec{u} \geq 0$ and $\vec{u}\cdot \vec{u} = 0$ 
if and only if $\vec{u} = \vec{0}$.
\item $(c_1 \vec{u}_1 +\dots + c_p \vec{u}_p)\cdot \vec{w} = c_1\vec{u}_1\cdot \vec{w}
+c_p\vec{u}_p\cdot \vec{w}$.
\end{itemize}
 

\textbf{Definition}[Length]
The {\em length} (or {\em norm})  of $\vec{v}$ is the non-negative scalar $\|\vec{v}\|$ 
defined by 
\[
 \| \vec{v} \| = \sqrt{\vec{v} \cdot \vec{v}} =
\sqrt{v_1^2 + v_2^2 +\dots + v_n^2} \ \text{ and } \ \|\vec{v} \|^2 = 
\vec{v}\cdot \vec{v}.
 \]

\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile] \frametitle{Note}
 This definition is chosen so that the Pythagorean theorem holds (that is, in two 
dimensions the length $c$ of the vector which is the hypotenuse of a right triangle 
with horizontal length $a$ and vertical height $b$ satisfies $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$. 
 

\textbf{Facts}
\begin{itemize}
 \item For any scalar $c$, $\| c\vec{v}\| = |c| \ \|\vec{v}\|$.  
 \item A vector of length 1 is called a \textbf{unit vector}.  
 \item  If $\vec{v}\neq \vec{0}$ then $\frac{1}{\| \vec{v} \|} \vec{v}$ 
is a unit vector and is in the same direction as $\vec{v}$.   
 \item  The above process is called normalizing. 
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile] \frametitle{Example}
 Find a unit vector which is in the same direction as $\vec{v} =
\left[ \begin{array}{rrrr} 1 \\ 1 \\ 2 \end{array} \right]$.
 

\textbf{Definition}
For $\vec{u}$ and $\vec{v}$ in $\mathbb R^n$, the {\em distance between $\vec{u}$
and $\vec{v}$}, written as $\text{dist}(\vec{u},\vec{v})$ is the length
of the vector $\vec{u}-\vec{v}$.  That is,
\[
 \text{dist}(\vec{u},\vec{v})  = \| \vec{u} - \vec{v} \|.
\]
  

\textbf{Example}

$\text{dist}\left[\left[ \begin{array}{rrrr}7 \\ 2 \end{array} \right],\left[ \begin{array}{rrrr} 4 \\ 3 \end{array} \right]\right]$.

 Two vectors in $\mathbb R^n$ are {\em orthogonal} if and only if $\vec{u}\cdot\vec{v}=0$.

\begin{itemize}
\item Angle between two vectors is 0, meaning $cos\theta = 0$ meaning $\theta = 90$ degrees.
\item In 2D, there will be two such orthogonal (perpendicular) vectors to a given vector.
\item if the given vector is 3D, there will be infinite such orthogonal vectors, but all will lie in a single plane.
\item In higher dimensions, the orthogonal entity is called as a Hyperplane, all passing through base of the vector.
\item Hyperplane separates space into 2  halves.

\textbf{Theorem}[Pythagorus]
 $||\vec{u} - \vec{v}||^2 = ||\vec{u}||^2 + ||\vec{v}||^2$ if and only if $\vec{u}$ and $\vec{v}$ are orthogonal.

Suppose that $W\le \mathbb R^n$.
\begin{itemize}
  \item  If for all $\vec{w}\in W$, $\vec{z}\cdot\vec{w}=0$,l then we say that $\vec{z}$ is orthogonal to $W$ and write $z\perp W$.
  \item We define the orthogonal compliment of $W$ as $W^{\perp}=\{\vec{z}\in \mathbb R^n \vec{z}\perp W\}$.
\end{itemize}
  

\textbf{Example}

  \item  $W^{\perp}\le \mathbb R^n$.
\end{itemize}
  

\textbf{Theorem}
 Suppose that $A$ is an $n\times n$ matrix.
\begin{itemize}
  \item $(\mbox{Row}(A))^{\perp} = \mbox{Nul}(A)$.
  \item $(\mbox{Col}(A))^{\perp}=\mbox{Nul}(A^t)$.
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile] \frametitle{Note}
 In two or three dimensions, the projection of $\vec{v}$ onto $\vec{u}$
has length $\| \vec{v} \| \cos \theta$, where $\theta$ is the angle between
the vectors.  Hence
\[
 \| \vec{v} \| \cos \theta = c \| \vec{u} \|
\]
so that 
\[
 \vec{u}\cdot\vec{v} = \| \vec{u} \| \| \vec{v} \| \cos \theta.
\]
In higher dimensions than three we use this to {\em define} the angle between two vectors.

$$ d (\vec{u}, \vec{v}) = \norm{ \vec{u} - \vec{v}} =  \sqrt{ \avg{ \vec{u} - \vec{v}, \vec{u} - \vec{v} } } $$

\begin{itemize}

\item $\norm{\vec{v}} \ge 0$ \ and \ $\norm{\vec{v}} = 0$ iff $\vec{v} = \vec{0}$.

\item $\norm{ k \vec{v}} = |k| \, \norm{\vec{v}}$

  \begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Linear Combinations}
\textbf{Definition}
Let $p$ be a positive integer. Given vectors $\vec{u}_1, \vec{u}_2, \dots \vec{u}_p$
in $\mathbb R^n$, and $c_1, c_2, \dots c_p$ in $\mathbb R$, the vector
\[
 \vec{u} = c_1 \vec{u}_1 + c_2 \vec{u}_2 + \dots c_p\vec{u}_p
\]
is called a linear combination of the vectors $\vec{u}_1, \dots \vec{u}_p$ with
weights $c_1, \dots c_p$.

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
  \begin{frame}[fragile]
\textbf{Example}
\[
 2\left[\begin{array}{r}1 \\-2 \\ 7  \end{array}\right]\ 
 + \ 3\left[\begin{array}{r} 1 \\ 1 \\ 1 \end{array}\right] \ 
 + \ -2\left[\begin{array}{r}2 \\ 3 \\ -8  \end{array}\right]
 = \left[\begin{array}{r}\qquad  \\ \qquad \\ \qquad \end{array}\right] \]     
is a linear combination of $ \left[\begin{array}{r}1 \\-2 \\ 7  \end{array}\right],$ $\left[\begin{array}{r} 1 \\ 1 \\ 1 \end{array}\right]$ and $\left[\begin{array}{r}2 \\ 3 \\ -8  \end{array}\right]$ with weights $2,3 ,-2$.


\textbf{Geometry} 
Let $\vec{u} = \left[\begin{array}{r} 1 \\ 1 \end{array}\right]$ and 
$\vec{v} = \left[\begin{array}{r} 1 \\ -1 \end{array}\right]$.  Show all
linear combinations of $\vec{u}$ and $\vec{v}$ on a graph.

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
  \begin{frame}[fragile]
\textbf{Exercise}
let 
$\vec{u}_1 = \left[\begin{array}{r} 1 \\ 2 \\ 5 \end{array}\right]$
$\vec{u}_2 = \left[\begin{array}{r} 2 \\ 1 \\ 3 \end{array}\right]$ and 
$\vec{b} = \left[\begin{array}{r} -4 \\ 1 \\ 1 \end{array}\right]$
Is $\vec{b}$ a linear combination of $\vec{u}_1$ and $\vec{u}_2$

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
  \begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Vector Equations}
\textbf{Facts}
A vector equation 
\[
 x_1 \vec{v}_1  + x_2 \vec{v}_2 + \dots + x_n \vec{v}_n =\vec{b}
\]
has the same solution set as the system of equations whose augmented matrix is 
\[
 \left[\begin{array}{ccccc}
  | & | & \dots & | & | \\
  \vec{v}_1 & \vec{v}_2 & \dots & \vec{v}_n & \vec{b} \\
  | & | & \dots & | & | \\
 \end{array}\right]
\]
In particular, $\vec{b}$ is a linear combination of $\vec{v}_1, \dots \vec{v}_n$
if and only if the system of linear equations is consistent.

\textbf{Definition}
 Suppose $\vec{v}_1, \vec{v}_2, \dots \vec{v}_p \in \mathbb R^n$.
 We define 
 \[
  \mbox{Span}(\vec{v}_1, \vec{v}_2, \dots ,\vec{v}_p) =
 \left\{
 c_1 \vec{v}_1 + c_2 \vec{v}_2 + \dots c_p \vec{v}_p: c_1, c_2, \dots , c_p \in \mathbb R 
 \right\}
 \]    
 That is, Span$(\vec{v}_1, \dots , \vec{v}_p)$ is the set of all linear combinations
of $\vec{v}_1, \dots , \vec{v}_p$.

\textbf{Note}
\begin{itemize}
\item The span of $\vec{0}$ in $\mathbb R^2$ or $\mathbb R^3$ is the single point $\vec{0}$.
\item The span of a single non-zero vector in $\mathbb R^2$ or $\mathbb R^3$ is a line through $\vec{0}$.
\item The span of two non-zero vectors in $\mathbb R^3$ is either a plane through $\vec{0}$ or, if one
vector is a scalar multiple of the other, a line through $\vec{0}$.
\end{itemize}


\textbf{Exercise}
Let $\vec{v}_1 = \left[\begin{array}{r}1 \\ 1 \\ 2 \end{array}\right]$, 
$\vec{v}_2 = \left[\begin{array}{r} 2 \\ 5 \\ -3 \end{array}\right]$ and 
$\vec{b} = \left[\begin{array}{r} -9 \\ -30 \\ 31 \end{array}\right]$.
Span$(\vec{v}_1,\vec{v}_2)$ is a plane in $\mathbb R^3$  Is $\vec{b}$ in that plane?
